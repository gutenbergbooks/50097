<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Good morning, Mr. Thorsby!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>startled, squashes letter into his pocket</i>)
Eh! Oh, good morning! I was&mdash;I&mdash;wanted to see Mr.
Pillenger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Mr. Pillenger ain't much in the 'abit of climbin'
trees before breakfast. (<i>puts jam on table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> No, of course not. (<i>he jumps down</i>) I
thought I saw a bird's nest, (<i>looks</i>) I was mistaken;
but feeling (<span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>heard whistling the A.M.B.</i>) rather
warm after my walk, I fancied it would be cooler under
the branches. My object, in fact, was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Shady! (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> I was sayin' it's shady under the h'oak. (<i>puts
toast on table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Exactly.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Newsboy</span> <i>enters at gate, crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and calls towards
kitchen window</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Papiers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Late again! (<i>crosses in front of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> No, I ain't. (<i>turns and faces</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Yes, you h'are. (<i>looks at silver watch</i>) Four
minutes and a half late. (<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and reads
letter</i>) Your prospects of a Christmas-box are darkenin'
week by week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Well, but I say, Gandy! (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Mr. Gandy! A leetle more respect might assist
your grandmother's next h'application to the coal and
blanket fund. Now, is this to-day's "Standard?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Yus! (<i>giving it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Very good. And the other papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> "Sportin' Life!" (<i>gives it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> "Sporting Life!" (<span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>sees jam, and works
round to top of table</i>) That's rather an innovation, isn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) It's for Captain Dorvaston.
We deplore it, but we're 'elpless. (<i>places
papers on table</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>, <i>startles</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>and comes towards
him</i>. <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>backs towards gate. To</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span>) Go along with
you, and, mind me, if there's any more tip-cat down
our road, I call at the police station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> All right. Keep your 'air on. (<i>goes off, singing
the chorus of A.M.B.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>comes out of house with bowl of flowers</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Good morning, Mr. Thorsby! (<span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Good morning! (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You're an early visitor. (<i>puts bowl on table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Yes, I&mdash;I was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>has crossed and turns at porch</i>) Bird's
nestin'! (<i>he goes in through porch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>they both watch him off</i>, <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>goes up a
little and down again</i>) What does he mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> He caught me standing up on that seat. I
had just found your letter, (<i>she hushes him</i>) and I
had to give some explanation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And couldn't you rise to anything better than
that? My dear Harry, what an idiot you are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> You see, I greatly dislike any deviation from
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Truth is a luxury very few of us can afford.
When you and I are married&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>advancing</i>) Darling! (<i>rushes to embrace
her, she waves him off</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Stay where you are! All the back windows
have eyes to them. Muslin curtains don't count. When
we are married&mdash;&mdash; (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> In fact, after to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, Harry, do shut up a minute. You object
to shams, how is a properly organised household to be
carried on without 'em? (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of breakfast table</i>)
Suppose I'm up to my neck in something important&mdash;putting
finishing touches to a new ball-dress, we'll say&mdash;and
some female horror calls&mdash;mustn't I be out because
I happen to be at home? Deviation from the
truth! My dear boy, I should deviate for all I was
worth. So you got my letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And your answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I posted it in our usual letter box. (<i>going to
tree</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> All right, I'll get it directly. Does it give
full directions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I think so. (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Got the special license?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Yes. (<i>makes to embrace her, she puts him off
and points to windows</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You've arranged with old Bristowe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And we bike over to Ingledene Church&mdash;what
time? Early of course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I said nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Very well. (<i>rises</i>) Now you'd better go. (<i>he
objects</i>) They'll be coming out to breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>again advancing</i>) Darling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>motions him off again</i>) Back windows!
(<i>crosses up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>to house to see if they have been seen</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>turning towards her</i>) I was going to say
that I can't help regretting the way we are treating
Captain Dorvaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You mind your own business. (<i>she crosses
down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and leans on rustic table</i>) Captain Dorvaston
is in my department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I never fully understood how you came to be
engaged. (<i>crosses to her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Simple enough. My father was a colonel who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
did some rather big things on the Indian frontier, and
in a dust up with one of the native Princes got himself
into rather a tight corner. Jack Dorvaston&mdash;he was
only a subaltern then&mdash;pulled him out of it, and in fact
saved his life; so when the governor died a year or two
later, he left a strong wish behind that the Captain
should marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>crosses round and sits on tree seat</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) It
was a queer way of showing his gratitude, seeing that
I was then a particularly unattractive child, all elbows
and knees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Lucy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> It's all right, don't be nervous; time has
softened them down. (<i>beckons him nearer</i>) I have a
notion that Jack has always funked the thing, but his
colonel had given his orders, (<i>he sits on table</i>) don't
you see? And that was enough for <i>him</i>. I don't regard
discipline&mdash;military or parental&mdash;with the same amount
of respect. British freedom means the right to make a
fool of one's self in one's own way. You're my way,
and that's enough for <i>you</i>. (<i>he tries to take her hand,
she draws it away</i>) Back windows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I suppose no one guesses that we&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Mean business! No, with the exception possibly
of Cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Cook! (<i>he looks at her in surprise</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Somehow I've a notion she's tumbled to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Would it matter? Would she&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Prattle about it? No, I think she rather likes
me&mdash;tolerates would be a better word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Tolerates? A woman of that class?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Cook is a very great personage; she rules the
vicarage. Auntie made a show of resistance at first,
but Uncle and Jack have been abject slaves from the
start.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh yes; when a woman is striking in appearance,
evidently has a past history, and can make an
omelette, I don't see what's going to stop her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> What's her history?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How should I know? She was recommended
to us by the Duchess of Sturton at the time she opened
the bazaar&mdash;you remember. Local philanthropic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Then you've nothing tangible to go on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Not from a masculine standpoint. (<i>rises</i>)
Cook doesn't give herself away, but, like Achilles, she
has one vulnerable point, and in the same locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> How is that? (<i>rising with</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> She wears the neatest, quietest shoes imaginable,
only I happened to notice they have Louis heels.
(<i>he looks in wonder</i>) That tells you nothing&mdash;the inference
is too subtle; but it's quite enough for me.
(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>appears with butter on tray, he comes right
of table</i>) Make a dignified clerical exit&mdash;here comes
Gandy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>takes hat and backs to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I think I won't
wait, Miss Lucy. (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>coughs</i>, <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>turns nervously,
and looks at him</i>) So will you kindly give my
message to Mr. Pillenger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Certainly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Thank you. (<i>crosses to gate</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Good morning. (<i>he looks towards</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>&mdash;<i>catches</i>
<span class="smcap">Gandy's</span> <i>eye and exits through gate</i>. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>is
applauding his exit when</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>turns and hides her
action</i>. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>sits on garden chair and opens the
"Standard"</i>) Gandy! what is there for breakfast?
(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>has crossed to top of table and placed butter
on it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> H'eggs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Poached?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Biled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Auntie said poached.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Cook said biled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh! There's some fish, isn't there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But Auntie particularly mentioned fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Cook thought kidneys would be <i>preferable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh! (<i>she reads paper</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>comes out</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>looking at his watch</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Ah, Lucy! breakfast not ready? (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>rises
and crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Breakfast is late&mdash;as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> As usual? What do you mean by as usual?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I mean&mdash;as usual. (<i>returns to seat</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Cook is most punctual. If some trivial hitch
has occurred this morning, I daresay a perfectly reasonable
explanation will be forthcoming. (<i>takes "Sporting
Life" off table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Kidneys was late! (<i>at table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Kidneys was late! (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>)&mdash;er&mdash;were late.
I knew it! That man Skeggs' meat&mdash;which I more than
suspect of being colonial&mdash;is never delivered in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span>) Explain to Cook that the delay is of no
consequence, and beg her not to hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>speaking as he goes</i>) She won't hurry! (<i>he
goes into the house</i>; <span class="smcap">Pil.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>look at each other</i>;
<span class="smcap">Pil.</span> <i>then opens paper and sees his mistake</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>takes "Standard" from</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) If I shall not
be depriving you of the "Standard"&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Not at all! (<i>she picks up "Sporting Life"</i>)
I'll have a look at Jack's "Sporting Life."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crossing to table, turn to her</i>) By the way,
during the&mdash;I trust&mdash;brief interval of time that must
elapse before your marriage with Captain Dorvaston,
you might hint to him that the newspaper he favours
is at variance with the general tone of a pious household.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I'll mention it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I am obliged to you. (<i>crosses and sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>comes out through French window</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Good morning, Audley!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Good morning. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>rises, crosses and kisses</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>and returns</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Well, Lucy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Good morning, Auntie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Is breakfast not ready? (<i>looking at table
through glasses</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No, it isn't ready&mdash;not quite ready. I have no
doubt it's <i>nearly</i> ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I shall really have to speak sharply to Cook.
(<i>moves towards kitchen</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I see no necessity for any&mdash;er&mdash;drastic step of
that description. The delay is due to that man Skeggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Skeggs? (<i>returns to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Skeggs. It is also traceable, in a minor degree
to yourself&mdash;your injudicious selection of kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Kidneys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes; you are aware of my preference for fish,
and therefore I consider the substitution of kidneys&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I ordered fish&mdash;and I did <i>not</i> order kidneys.
Cook is entirely responsible for the change, and I shall
certainly&mdash;&mdash; (<i>moves towards kitchen again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah! Hannah! If Cook understood your
order, which is by no means obvious (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>
<i>crosses round and sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>), she was doubtless influenced
by&mdash;er&mdash;by Lucy's partiality for kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I never touch them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Well, she couldn't know that. Really I think
this discussion has been sufficiently prolonged.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Here is the breakfast. Let us endeavor to approach
it in a seemly spirit. Where is Captain Dorvaston?
(<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Upon my word, Lucy, considering
the ties that will unite you, I hope <i>very</i> shortly,
to Captain Dorvaston, I think he might conform to my
rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Jack was late last night. (<i>sits and takes
napkin out of ring</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> He <i>was</i>. Creaking boots after midnight are a
serious infliction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I'll call up to him if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I should be indebted. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>rises and goes up</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hulloa!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Breakfast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> What say, little woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Breakfast! Kidneys! Devilled! (<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> What are your plans for to-day, Audley?
(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>has undone napkin and is pouring out
tea</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I expect to be rather busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> It's sermon day, isn't it? (<i>hands toast to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
Pillenger</span>, <i>and takes an egg and toast herself</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> It <i>is</i>. So I trust your piano practice will be
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I'm going down to the village. I suppose
you'll have broken the back of it by lunch time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Possibly&mdash;probably!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>comes out from French window; takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> <i>hand between both his caressingly</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> 'Fraid I'm a bit late. How are you, sir? (<i>bowing
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> In my ordinary health, I am obliged to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You look astonishing fit. (<i>sits</i>) Now d'you
know, I feel as jumpy as a flea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Captain Dorvaston!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Fact, ma'am! (<i>takes his napkin out of ring</i>)
How are <i>you</i> this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Without being actually indisposed, I feel&mdash;&mdash; (<i>hands
tea to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Chippy&mdash;I know; same here. Where are those
kidneys you were shouting about, Lucy? (<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span>
<i>hands them</i>) Thanks! (<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>passes kidneys
to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>, <i>which he serves himself</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You kept it up again last night, Jack?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I had a gentle flutter at the Plough and Rainbow.
There was a little pool, so of course I went in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I hope you changed your things, (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>laugh</i>) Captain Dorvaston. Damp clothing
is so very dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Pool is a kind of billiards, Auntie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Oh, I misunderstood! Your tea, Captain
Dorvaston. (<i>she hands tea to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thank you, ma'am. (<span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>hands salt,
etc.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How did you do over it? (<i>hands toast to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> So so. I took a few lives at the finish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Dear me! It sounds rather a bloodthirsty
pastime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> There was a man there named Crayll&mdash;nailing
good player! Potted 'em just as he liked. He seemed
to be a thirsty little beggar. I should say he took a
bit of knowing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Who's that, Jack?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> This fellah Crayll. He's stopping at the Plough
and Thingummy&mdash;we're going to try a horse together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> To-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes. Said he'd call round some time this morning.
(<i>pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah, we must dine earlier this evening, in
view of the Penny Reading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Another of those festive gatherings! Hope you
don't expect me to tip 'em anything this time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No, Captain Dorvaston; your contribution on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the last occasion may have been well intentioned&mdash;I
judge no man, and will hope so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thought it was just the thing to wake 'em up
after that Shakespearian bit of yours&mdash;The Ball of
Worsted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The Fall of Wolsey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I was not present last time. What did Captain
Dorvaston read?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It was an account of the last American glove
fight, don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Described with a wealth of technical detail.
(<i>hands his cup to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>) The whole occurrence
was most regrettable. I was observing, Hannah,
we shall have to dine earlier&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I had some idea of making it a cold meal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Cold meal! A most unpleasant suggestion.
Cold food, especially in the evening, has a tendency to
lie heavy on the stom&mdash;er&mdash;that is, I see nothing feasible
in the notion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh no, hang it all, ma'am! Cold stuff ain't the
kind of thing to do a Penny Reading on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I thought under the circumstances it might
be easier for Cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> What? (<i>long pause, the men look at her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But as you both object&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hold on, ma'am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> One moment, Hannah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I will explain to Cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah! Hannah! You're so hasty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hannah&mdash;ma'am&mdash;pity to be hasty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> If you will permit me to explain myself, Captain
Dorvaston? I have no wish, Hannah, to add weight
to Cook's very arduous duties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hear, hear! (<i>slaps the table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>raising his voice</i>) And therefore it seems to
me&mdash;er&mdash;unmanly to lay stress upon possible digestive
difficulties which fortitude and a little pepsin should
enable us to face with calmness. Let the meal be a
cold one. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>has folded up napkin again, and taken
"Standard" from back of chair, and is reading it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Point of fact, it makes a pleasant change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But, Audley!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The question is decided. We will not pursue
the subject. (<i>pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) Anything in the paper?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> There's something about the Huntworth Divorce
case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> We have no wish to hear any news relating to
such a matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> But it's an old business, ain't it? When I was
at Malta last year, the chaps used to chat about it at
mess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Lord Huntworth brought the divorce, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes, Lord Huntworth was the petitioner. It
was a sad case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I know Bob Carruthers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Who's he? (<i>rises and crosses up to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>&mdash;<i>still
reading the paper</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> The co&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Bob was an extraordinary good chap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> How can any individual be described as good
who has occupied the position of&mdash;er&mdash;a co-respondent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Bob managed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> You seem to ignore poor Lord Huntworth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Didn't know Huntworth&mdash;did know Bob. He
once lent me a monkey when I wanted it badly&mdash;lent
it when <i>he</i> wanted it badly. Devilish good chap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Beg pardon, sir&mdash;slipped out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Did you know <i>Lady</i> Huntworth, Jack?
(<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and sits under tree</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No. Heard she was a nice woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Nice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> So fellahs who met her used to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But I always understood the suit was undefended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Entirely undefended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Matrimonial thimblerig is a confusing game to
watch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Thimblerig?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Three thimbles, don't you know? Husband&mdash;wife&mdash;and
the other chap. (<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>looks up</i>)
Well, what I meant to say was, it ain't easy for the
looker-on to say which thimble the fault is under. By-the-bye,
I saw something in the paper about Lady
Huntworth the other day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Surely the whole affair is uninteresting and
unsavory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Noosance to forget a thing! What was the bit
you were reading, Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> That yesterday the rule was made absolute.
What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Only that the time was up. They keep 'em in
blinkers for six months after the verdict. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>draws napkin through the ring</i>) But that wasn't what
I read? What the devil was it now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! Really! Really! I think we've all finished,
haven't we? (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>appears with letters, three
of which</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>takes, and two</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>)
Hannah, you will probably wish to interview Cook.
(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>rises, takes chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>, <i>sits and begins to load
his pipe</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I will see her in your presence. (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span>
<i>has come back to top of table</i>) Gandy, will you ask
Cook to come to me? I wish to give her my orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> H'orders? (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>fills pipe and lights it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> I'll name it to her. (<i>slowly exits through porch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>opening letter, which he holds during the
whole scene with</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) Hannah, I would suggest that
whatever you have to say to Cook may be said calmly
and without undue severity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>opening letters which she holds during the
whole scene with</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) That should be left to my discretion;
a stand must be made somewhere.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>has come out of kitchen during this; she
advances to the table</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You wished to speak to me? (<i>the men turn
and face her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Yes, Cook. I want to give you the orders
for to-day's dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly! What do you fancy? What would
you all like? (<i>she glances round, both men beam at
her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Before we speak of that I have a word to
say with regard to the breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> To-morrow's breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> No, to-day's. I am very much astonished and
annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What was wrong with the breakfast? When I
sent it out it looked all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Why were my directions disregarded? I
ordered the eggs to be poached&mdash;you boiled them; I
mentioned fried bacon&mdash;none came to table; I requested
you to procure fish&mdash;you gave us kidneys. Now what
have you to say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm afraid I forgot about the eggs? I haven't
any other excuse to offer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> A most reasonable explanation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Things do slip one's memory. (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>
<i>glares at</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I didn't cook any bacon; it had got rather low,
and I didn't think the result would please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Impossible to cut rashers from bacon that is&mdash;er&mdash;practically
non-existent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thing no fellah could do! (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>
<i>glares at him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I remember you did mention fish, but you've
had a good deal of fish lately, so I thought I'd try you
with kidneys. But if there has been any inconvenience,
I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> There has been no inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> None at all. (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>glares at</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah, I think we may pass (as they say in
the House of Commons) to the orders of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hear, hear! (<span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>looks at him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Well, Cook, since you express your regret
(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>laugh</i>) I will say no more. Now
as to this evening, you will be in sole charge of the
house, (<i>both men look up</i>) as I have given Keziah permission
to go to the Penny Reading&mdash;so I think we
will make it a cold meal, as that will entail less washing
up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Just as you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> We will begin with salmon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>reflectively</i>) Salmon? Yes, you might have
salmon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Pickled salmon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh, no, not pickled! (<i>both men shake their
heads</i>) That would be a pity! I'll make you a mayonnaise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Delightful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Rippin'!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I shall want some lettuces. I'll tell Gandy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> After that we will have two cold ducklings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Ducklings? It's late for ducklings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Maturity in poultry is to be deprecated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Leathery beasts at this time of the year. (<span class="smcap">Miss
Pillenger</span> <i>glares at</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Then why not a gosling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It's early for geese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Deuced early!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Entirely premature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> When I mentioned a goose I was thinking
of Mr. Pillenger. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>laugh</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! Hannah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hope, ma'am, when you mentioned a duck, you
were thinking of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I fail to understand you. My brother is exceedingly
partial to goose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> There's a ham in cut, so I think we'd better
fall back on fowls. It isn't easy to do anything very
novel with cold fowls, but if I stuff and glaze them, I've
no doubt they'll pass muster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But, Cook, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You like sweets, of course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Certainly, you had better make us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Will you leave the sweets to me? I want to
try a new kind of fruit salad; it's my first attempt,
but you'll find it will be all right&mdash;and perhaps I might
throw in a shape of jelly&mdash;we'll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What time will you dine?&mdash;at least it isn't dinner&mdash;what
time will you sup?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> At seven to-night, instead of half-past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Seven! I shall be ready. Is there anything
else you wish to say to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> No, Cook; I don't suppose anything will be
gained by my saying any more. (<i>turns away and reads
letters</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Very good! (<i>takes kidney dish off table</i>, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Pillenger</span> <i>assisting her; she crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>speaking eagerly</i>) Ah! here's that bit about
Lady Huntworth. (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>looks round at him in a
startled manner</i>) It's in the Agony column. (<i>reads</i>)
"Will Lady Huntworth communicate with Messrs.
Brampton and Stokes, Capel Court, on a matter of considerable
importance?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Why should we resume the discussion of that
disgraceful woman? (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>turns and looks at him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Why, indeed? (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>looks at her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) When we were talking just now,
couldn't remember where I'd read that. Hate to forget
a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Cook! (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>stands thinking quietly</i>)
Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I&mdash;beg your pardon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> We needn't keep you, if you quite understand
about the supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh, quite, thanks! (<i>exit into kitchen</i>; <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>rises, looks after her</i> <span class="smcap">U. B.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Don't you think that woman has a very
singular manner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Singular! No, she is certainly superior&mdash;very
superior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>rises, crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) She is <i>so</i> superior that
she seems above taking my orders.</p>

him to call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> He came early this morning, but he wouldn't
wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! He knows I wished to see him. I
have two christenings at one-thirty, and an interment at
three. However, Lucy and&mdash;er&mdash;Captain Dorvaston
(<i>crosses and brings</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>down</i>) as you are together
for once&mdash;I will avail myself of the opportunity
to say a few serious words to you both. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>look at each other nervously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Peg away, sir! (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>stands near table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>
<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>stands centre</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I have no wish to appear unduly inquisitive on
a subject with which I have merely an indirect concern
(<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table</i>) but may I enquire if you have fixed the
time that will make you both&mdash;that will make us all
happy? (<i>puts arm on table and leans back.</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>again look at each other</i>) Has a date been
arrived at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Not precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Not to a day or so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Have you settled on the week or the month?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No, we haven't got as far as that. But something
was said about the autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> The late autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>has been leaning his arm on the table&mdash;now
sits up and faces them</i>) The late autumn! (<i>sits up</i>)
But last autumn something was said about the early
spring; the question was then relegated to the late sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>mer.
This is July, and where are we? (<i>he leans back
and is about to rest his arm on table, but</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>has
just removed it, with the result that he loses his balance
and comes on his hand</i>. <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>goes to his
assistance</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Allow me, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Thank you. I was unaware that Gandy had
removed the table. But, to resume what I was saying&mdash;can
you give me any definite information?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You see, sir, I haven't worried Lucy, because
I know girls are apt to be a bit&mdash;a bit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Noosance! I've lost a word. Girls are apt to
be a bit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Coy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> That's it! Thanks, little woman&mdash;a bit coy.
(<i>comes to</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Coy! (<i>rises, comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Well, the expression
hardly seems to me to convey Lucy's habitual demeanour;
but in any case she is of age. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>)
You were twenty-one last week I think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes, I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Your small fortune is carefully tied up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Quite right, sir, so it ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Captain Dorvaston (<i>patting him on the shoulder</i>)
is in a firm financial position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Pretty fair as things go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Then why any further delay? Why not August?
Nice seaside month. My own thoughts are turning
towards Eastbourne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I had an offer from a fellah I know to go halves
in a shoot this August, (<i>going to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) but I wouldn't
let that stand in the way, not for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Thanks, Jack, (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>a little</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Take my advice, let no trivial obstacle intervene
between you. Let there be no postponement or interruption.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> There shan't be, sir. (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>comes out
from porch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> That's well! (<i>they shake hands</i>) That's well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Gandy! (<i>both men turn round to her without
releasing hands</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Do you want anything, Cook? (<i>crosses up to
her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Anything I could do? (<i>they both go up</i>, <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>on her</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I wanted Gandy for a second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Certainly. He was here just now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Saw him a minute ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I'll call him. (<i>goes</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Gandy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Fancy he went this way. (<i>goes</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Gandy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Sorry to detain you! Gandy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Noosance having to wait! Gandy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Pray don't bother about it; I only wanted him
to pick me some parsley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No trouble at all. Where <i>is</i> Gandy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> What's happened to the beggar? Could I&mdash;er&mdash;take
on the job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! absurd! How should you know the
proper way to&mdash;er&mdash;pick parsley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Never too old to learn, sir. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>)
Where should I be likely to drop across it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> There's a small parsley bed over there (<i>she
points left</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Right-O! (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <i>kneels</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> But it's really too bad to trouble you. (<i>crosses</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>goes with</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>on her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Not a bit! To oblige you I'd pick oakum!
(<i>he kneels and picks parsley</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;regret&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;the absence of Gandy&mdash;as
to which I shall require some explanation, should
have caused you all this inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It doesn't signify. Captain Dorvaston is doing
the work very nicely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Fact is I've broken out in a new place. Where
shall I put the pieces? (<i>holding up parsley</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> In this dish. (<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>takes dish from
her, and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>snatches it from him&mdash;puts parsley
in it, and holds it out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It's very easy when you get into the swing of
it. Will that be enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Plenty, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> There! (<i>rises, crosses to hand her bowl</i>; <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>
<i>trying to get hold of it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm much obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Don't you think I should make a good gardener?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Capital, I should say. (<i>crosses to porch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! tut! (<i>she goes up stage</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Cook! Cook! (<i>she turns round</i>) If I try for
the situation will you give me a character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm afraid I haven't one to spare! (<i>he laughs;
she returns to the kitchen</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>going up to window, then turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>)
By George she's a devilish&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! tut! (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C</span>.; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>knocks on the table
two or three times to draw their attention</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Just so, sir; but I mean she <i>is</i>&mdash;don't you know&mdash;isn't
she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) She is undoubtedly possessed
of great refinement for anyone in her present
sphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Refinement! (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> We gathered from the Duchess of Sturton that
Cook had seen better days. Her Grace is somewhat
vague conversationally; but we understood as much as
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>confidentially, he hides</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>from</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger's</span>
<i>view</i>) Funny thing a woman like that should be
running loose. Odd she hasn't married some fellah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> It is singular&mdash;in fact remarkable. For a certain
type of man she would make&mdash;I should say&mdash;an
admirable wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Just the wife for a soldier man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Pardon me, I disagree with you. No&mdash;she has
a quietude, a dignified reserve&mdash;that would fit her to
preside over the household of a staid medical man&mdash;or
a barrister in fair practice&mdash;who was no longer young&mdash;or
even&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash; (<i>catches</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston's</span> <i>eye</i>) But
we're wasting the morning. (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Don't say that, uncle. (<i>they both stare at
her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Lucy! (<i>crosses to top of chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hulloa, little woman! Still there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes, I'm still here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> By George, sir, (<i>crosses and sits on chair facing
the others</i>) weren't we all chatting over something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;think I was urging you both&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You were urging us to name the day&mdash;and to
avoid any kind of trivial interruption. (<i>the men look
at each other</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;believe that is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And Jack agreed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And I chimed in with the general sentiment.
But of course&mdash;at the time&mdash;it was impossible to foresee
the parsley, (<i>the two men exchange glances&mdash;she
rises</i>) I'm going down to the village. I punctured a
tire yesterday, and I've got to fetch my bike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I must get to work. I'm late as it is. (<i>crosses</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>looking at watch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Make it a ten minutes' sermon, sir, weather's
extr'ordinary hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I beg, Captain Dorvaston, you will spare me
any such irreverent suggestions; and I trust that if
you must sleep in a sacred edifice, you will render your
slumber less aggressive. (<i>moves to French window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You do snore, Jack&mdash;you nearly drowned the
second lesson last Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) <i>You</i> are not blameless. As
his future wife, it is your duty&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;privilege&mdash;to
nudge him. For what purpose has Heaven given
you elbows? (<i>he goes into house. Slight pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>puts pipe away</i>. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>crosses up, turns to chair</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Jack!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes, little woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Do you care for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> 'Course I do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How much? (<i>crosses to chair and kneels on
it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> How much? (<i>rises, crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Well, I'm a
bad hand at explaining things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> For instance, would you give up a big thing
for my sake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> What sort of big thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> An Empire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> A peerage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh, Lord, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Would you give up&mdash;a dish of parsley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>long puzzled look</i>) What do you mean? I&mdash;don't
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You're a humbug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Sorry you think that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Well, do something to please me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Anything I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Fetch me an orchid, (<i>he looks surprised</i>) to
wear this evening&mdash;there are lots in the orchid house&mdash;will
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> 'Course I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Thanks. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>crosses up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>crosses down to her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>places hands upon</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> <i>shoulder and speaking
over her shoulder</i>) Little woman! Ever since the
time when your dear old dad first gave us the word
of command, I've always had a pretty clear notion
where the word duty came in; so when once you've
pulled yourself together, and named the day, I mean
to pull myself together and do my level damnedest to
make you happy. D'you see? (<i>turns her round</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>facing him</i>) Yes, I see. (<i>puts hand on his
shoulder</i>) I'm quite sure you mean all you say, and
it's nice of you to say it, and to mean it. The only thing
is, you seem to be entering upon a matrimonial campaign
without any transports.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I don't follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>takes him by the lapels of coat</i>) When I
said you were a humbug, I meant there is one person
you are always trying to deceive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Who's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Jack Dorvaston! (<i>he looks bewildered</i>)
Don't you mind what I say; go and fetch my orchid.
(<i>turns him round and pushes him away. He pauses,
rubs his head reflectively, and at last strolls off</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>goes over to the tree and sits for a moment in thought.
She suddenly remembers the letter in tree, and jumps
on seat to get it.</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>has come out, bringing with
her two pudding basins which she places on the seat
under the garden window; she comes down to table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>
<i>to take up the newspaper, she catches sight of</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>who is trying to get the letter out of cavity</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Shall I do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, Cook, is that you? (<i>turning quickly</i>)
You startled me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Did I? I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> What was it you said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I offered to get your letter for you. I have a
longer reach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> What letter? (<i>jumps down</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The latest one from Mr. Thorsby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Cook! How dare you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm not naturally timid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You are excessively impertinent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Am I? Very likely. But as that is your opinion,
I'll chance a rather rude question&mdash;When are you
going to bolt with Mr. Thorsby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> What do you mean? I'm foolish to listen to
you at all. I shall go to my uncle and aunt and tell
them what you've just said. (<i>comes close to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, <i>then
wavers and takes a step back</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>pause</i>) If I am mistaken about you and Mr.
Thorsby, you would be quite right to tell them. Am I
mistaken? (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>tries to brave her, but her head droops</i>)
Quite so! Then I think I would get the compromising
letter out of the tree and say no more about it&mdash;unless
you'll let <i>me</i> do it. (<i>makes a movement to get
letter</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, no! (<i>she jumps hastily on seat and gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
letter</i>) There! I don't care if you <i>do</i> know. Anybody
may know after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> So it's to be to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>jumps down</i>) Yes, it is. I am bound to
trust you&mdash;I can't help myself; so if you choose to
give the whole thing away, you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I shan't do that. On the contrary, I should
like to do any little thing I could to help you. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>looks in wonder</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Thank you. (<i>slight pause; sits</i>) How did
you find out&mdash;about&mdash;us? (<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>goes up a step</i>) Two or three Sundays ago&mdash;I
was coming home about ten in the evening&mdash;it was my
Sunday out&mdash;and as I came round the corner, you and
Mr. Thorsby were outside the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh! (<i>her eyes drop</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You were supposed to be spending the evening
with your friend Mrs. Bronson, if you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You didn't hear me coming and Mr. Thorsby
said good-night to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> He said it&mdash;very thoroughly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes&mdash;I believe he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That was how I found out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>after slight pause</i>) How funny it seems to
be talking to you about it all. What did you think&mdash;when
you saw&mdash;what you saw?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I was rather amused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> What did you think of <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Need we go into that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I should like you to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well, to tell you the truth, I thought you
weren't going quite straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Because of Captain Dorvaston?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I don't care for Captain Dorvaston&mdash;and I do
care for Mr. Thorsby. Surely it's better to marry the
man you love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I daresay it would be. I have nothing to say
against Mr. Thorsby&mdash;he seems a very pleasant young
fellow. I shouldn't think he would take to drink (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>looks in surprise</i>) or turn out badly to any special extent.
Of course, one can't tell beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Cook! (<i>surprised</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It would be all right if you weren't engaged to
another man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> But Jack isn't in love with <i>me</i>! (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You think not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> He likes me, and he wouldn't admit to anybody&mdash;certainly
not to himself&mdash;that I wasn't all the
world to him, and a bit over; but in the way of <i>real</i>
love he doesn't care a rap for <i>me</i>. He doesn't care&mdash;a
sprig of parsley! (<i>they look at each other</i>, <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>smiles</i>,
<i>and then</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>takes it up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Ah! that makes a difference. (<i>slight pause</i>)
Well, I must see to the mayonnaise. (<i>she turns and
goes up to the seat under the kitchen window, she begins
to break eggs into the basin.</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>goes up to porch
and sits on it, leaning her head against the pillar</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Do you know, I think you've been trying to
be very kind to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I was wondering&mdash;if you would tell me a little&mdash;about
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Tell you what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Tell me&mdash;about&mdash;your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> My life! No. It's waste of time to discuss
failures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You are a riddle&mdash;because you are&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;(<i>looking away</i>) Who are you?
What are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The Vicar's cook. (<i>their eyes meet</i>) You will
do me a favor, Miss Pillenger, if you will leave it at
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, certainly! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
be inquisitive.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Church clock chimes the half-hour.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm sure you didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I ought to go down to the village. (<i>crosses
to French window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>takes up fork and begins to stir eggs</i>) Don't
let me make you late for any appointment. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>puts
bowl on window</i>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>tries to laugh, and exits through

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>enters with large orchid</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Here you are, little woman,. (<i>looks for</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> She has gone down to the village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hulloa! Are you there, Cook? (<i>goes to her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Doing a bit of al fresco cooking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm mixing the mayonnaise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Are you, by George! That's devilish interesting.
I suppose, now, the kitchen's a bit hot for things
that go off color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Eggs, for instance. (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) I suppose
you start with eggs as a ground plan&mdash;and then&mdash;and
then you beat 'em. I often thought I should like to
beat eggs. (<i>seriously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>rising</i>) You can beat these; at least, you can
stir them, if you've a fancy that way. I want to baste
my two fowls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh! (<i>disappointed, stops stirring</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>she gives him the basin; pause; rises and
turns to porch</i>) Don't leave off stirring till I come
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>beginning to stir</i>) Not for worlds. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>turns</i>) But basting now, basting must be an unusual
engrossing branch of the science. Couldn't I come and
watch you baste?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>standing at entrance to porch</i>) No; go on
with the eggs please. That orchid seems rather in
your way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Got it for Lucy to wear to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Give it me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thanks! (<i>gives it to her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Tell her I'm taking care of it. (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I say, Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>pausing</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I want awfully to have a chat with you. (<i>edging
to end of bench</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You're chatting now. (<i>leans against post and
faces</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Can't talk here&mdash;people about&mdash;and there's the
basting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That's true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You'll be all alone this evening. Don't fancy
I shall want much of the Penny Reading&mdash;a ha'porth
will be plenty. Thought I'd stroll back&mdash;and <i>then</i>, don't
you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I think I understand <i>you</i>, but I'm doubtful if
you quite understand me. I've an idea that what you
want to say wouldn't interest me at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>rises</i>) You're wrong. I don't mean an atom
of harm&mdash;swear I don't. What I want to say I would
say before anybody&mdash;only I'd rather talk it over quietly.
May I come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> If you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Then you believe in me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>pauses</i>) Yes, I think I do. What time are
you likely to be back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Round about nine thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Nine thirty! All right! Don't forget to stir
the eggs (<i>he begins eagerly</i>) Very gently. (<i>enters porch
and then kitchen.</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>watches her off and is
looking through window, still stirring, when</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>
<i>comes out of French window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Captain Dorvaston! Captain Dorvaston! Captain
Dorvaston! (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>turns to him</i>) If you are
at leisure I should be glad if&mdash;&mdash; (<i>seeing basin and pointing
to it</i>) What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Fancy they call it a pudden basin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> What are you&mdash;&mdash;? why should you&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I'm stirring the eggs for the mayonnaise.
Cook asked me to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! I have received a letter from the
lawyers, respecting the draught copy of your marriage
settlement. I gave it to you. May I ask you to fetch
it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Just now, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Naturally. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Promised I wouldn't leave off stirring. Look
here, sir, if I fetch the paper, will you go on with the
eggs? (<i>gives him basin&mdash;they both stir&mdash;so as not to
stop</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Well, rather than cause&mdash;er&mdash;domestic inconvenience
(<i>takes basin</i>) but have the goodness to make
haste. The position is not without embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I'll look sharp, sir. (<i>crosses up back</i>) Don't
forget to stir very gently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The caution is quite superfluous. (<i>crosses to
back of chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>comes out followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>; <i>both

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Fowl? (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! (<i>conceals the basin behind him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>crossing to him</i>) You here, Audley? I am
accompanying Lucy to the village. I imagined you were
writing your sermon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I have been delayed by&mdash;er&mdash;unforeseen interruptions
(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>tells</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>about basin; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

wasting the freshness of the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I thought the moment was opportune for
the purchase of your new socks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But you have given me no instructions as
to pattern or texture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Both are indifferent to me. I rely on your taste
and judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I will go then. (<i>she moves</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>; <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>opens gate and stands talking to her</i>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>laughs</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> What is amusing you, Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I was laughing because&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I have no wish to hear. I object to frivolity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Do you, uncle? (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Wait for me,
Auntie. (<i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) Jack, where's my orchid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Cook is taking care of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>) What a treasure
Cook is. (<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) I wonder what any

each other for a second</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>laughs</i>) Sorry I let you in, sir, (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)
but Lucy won't say anything. I'll be back directly&mdash;and,
I say, you won't forget to stir very gently? (<i>exit
off</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>angrily</i>) No, I won't! No, I won't! No, I
won't! (<i>crosses; sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table, stirs violently for a

out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Captain Dorvaston! (<i>sees</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>) Is Captain
Dorvaston&mdash;&mdash; (<i>he turns round</i>) Oh, you've got
it! (<i>comes to top of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The basin? Yes. I was compelled to interrupt
Captain Dorvaston, so I was endeavoring to supply his
place; I fear with poor results. (<i>puts paper on seat</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Let me look? (<i>takes basin, crosses a little</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)
Thanks. (<i>she looks at it</i>) Oh, no&mdash;it's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I am relieved to hear it. Still, it probably needs
the&mdash;er&mdash;hum&mdash;the final touch of the artist. (<i>she turns
to go</i>) You don't care for&mdash;er&mdash;compliments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>looking round</i>) No! (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Rather an unkind restriction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> A bird of some experience is apt to change its
first opinion of bird-lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes, very true. But compliments that are the
expression of honest and&mdash;er&mdash;respectful appreciation&mdash;what
of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I don't know. I've never met that kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
compliment. If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to the
fowls. (<i>going up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>he follows her between tree and table to porch</i>)
I have no right to detain you from more congenial society.
(<i>door bell heard</i>) But I have something I particularly
wish to say to you. (<i>she looks at him</i>) Something
I wish to explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly! What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> My explanation might&mdash;in fact, would occupy
some time. (<i>door bell heard more violently</i>) The present
moment is obviously ill-chosen for the purpose.
You will be the sole occupant of the house this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Shall I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> <i>Every</i>body&mdash;Keziah included&mdash;is going to the
Penny Reading&mdash;even Gandy has asked permission to
visit his aged mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Has he an aged mother? I didn't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> He doesn't lay much stress on her&mdash;she suffers
from spasms, and is a Nonconformist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I thought if I came back early from the Parish
room, I could explain what I&mdash;er&mdash;wish to explain.
(<i>very violent ring at bell without interruption</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You would discuss this all-important matter
in the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> If you&mdash;er&mdash;see no objection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It's your kitchen, and your responsibility; but
if I were you I wouldn't explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Do you prohibit me from doing so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, come if you like. What time am I to expect
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> About nine o'clock. It's a quiet hour, and usually
free from callers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> We'll hope it will prove so. Very well&mdash;till
nine o'clock then. (<i>she goes into kitchen&mdash;he crosses
up to French window at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook's</span> <i>exit, still looking after
her, buried in thought</i>. <span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>comes through gateway,

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Mornin'! (<span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>does not hear, so</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>prods him in back with stick</i>) Mornin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Eh! Oh, good morning! (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> What time's the funeral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pill.</span> Funeral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Ain't anybody dead? I rang your beastly
front door bell till my arm ached; so I turned it up
and came round to the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> My butler&mdash;er&mdash;my male servant&mdash;is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
remiss. But to the best of my knowledge, he is still
alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Damn sorry for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I cannot countenance such language. My sacred
calling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>looking at him more attentively</i>) Oh, I see!
Didn't know you were a magpie. Come to think of it,
s'pose I passed your place of business a little way up
the road, (<i>pointing up</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Er&mdash;hum&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh, well then, I take back the damn. After
all, it don't do to open one's front door too quick. S'pose
you thought I was the Water Rate. (<i>puts foot on chair,
pulls out handkerchief, and dusts boot</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Gas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Then what the devil did you think? (<i>dusts
other boot</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I had no theory on the subject; and as to your
language&mdash;I really must beg&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Beg? Yes, that's your trade. Same time I'll
take back the devil. We don't often part company.
Talking of the devil, did you ever have D.T.?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> D.T.? D.T.? If you refer to the "Daily Telegraph,"
I usually read the "Standard."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> No, no! D.T. Jim-jams!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Jim-jams?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Delirium tremens&mdash;ever had 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Eh? What? Never, sir, never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Lucky beast! Well, when you <i>do</i> have 'em,
you'll know 'em again. I've had 'em twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> The last bout was a blazer. A man generally
sees snakes, or rats, or spiders. It was spiders with
me. (<i>makes movement of spider on</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger's</span> <i>chest</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Was it indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Yes&mdash;fat brutes with as many legs to 'em as
an Empire ballet&mdash;all over the walls by day&mdash;all over
the bed at night. If you lit a candle you saw 'em&mdash;if
you didn't you felt 'em. Pah! filthy devils! (<i>sits exhausted</i>)
Could I have a whiskey and soda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> You haven't mentioned the object of your visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Man named Dorvaston hangs out here, don't
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Captain Dorvaston is my guest at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Thought so. Promised to look him up.
We're goin' to price a horse&mdash;a nailer&mdash;risin' thirteen&mdash;and
well up to Dorvaston's weight&mdash;which is sayin'
somethin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Captain Dorvaston's physique is substantial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> If he stood on your foot, I expect you'd ask
him to move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Probably!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> He's goin' to be somethin' to you by marriage,
ain't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> He is affianced to my niece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Hope he'll like it. (<i>takes cigar out of case</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Why should he not, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I daresay you stick up for marriage&mdash;double
blessedness and all that kind of muck. (<i>biting end of
cigar</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I regard the married state as best calculated
to confer the greatest happiness that&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Have you ever bin married? (<i>looking up at
him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>lights cigar</i>) I thought not. You beggars
are always jawin' about what you don't understand.
You've never had D.T., but that wouldn't stop you preaching
about drink. You've never bin married, and yet
you get up in the pulpit and talk about Hell as if you
knew the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> May I ask, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Crayll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> May I enquire, Mr. Crayll, if <i>you</i> are married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>blows out light and smiles</i>) Not at present.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>comes out</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Ah! Here is Captain Dorvaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) There's the paper
you wanted, sir. It took a bit of finding. Keziah

Hulloa, Crayll! (<i>slaps him on back and crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Hulloa! (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) Now you have come, I will
ask Mr. Crayll to excuse me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Don't name it. (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Dorvaston
will see to me. I daresay he knows where the
whiskey's kept. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>laughs and goes up a
step or two with</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>aside</i>) Surely a most offensive person. (<i>crosses
up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> He's all right, sir. He takes a bit of knowing.
(<span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>goes into the house</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Now, for the Lord's sake get me a drop of
whiskey to wash the parson out of my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Whiskey it is! Take potash with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> A little potash. (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Very kind of you&mdash;extr'ordinary kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not at all. (<i>she disappears from window.</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Phew! (<i>wipes his forehead</i>) When I saw

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Why, who'd expect to see Lady Huntworth

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm not Lady Huntworth any longer. Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Lord Huntworth is the last person who should need the

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I'm keepin' out of the way&mdash;for&mdash;reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The local police don't strike me as being very

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Duns!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> It's debt&mdash;it ain't crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Ah! not yet. Well, good-day, Mr. Crayll. I
must go back to my cooking. (<i>crosses up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Here, hold on. Damn it, don't be in such a
hurry. (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I want to talk to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I have to baste the fowls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Curse the beastly fowls. I must see you alone
for half-an-hour, d'you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> It's infernal important. Will you meet me
to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Why not? What are you afraid of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm not afraid of <i>you</i>. I think you know that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> That long fool will be back in a minute.
You'll see me somehow to-night, because&mdash;you've
damned well got to&mdash;d'you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I haven't the smallest notion why you want to
see me, but since fate has played me a final dirty trick
by throwing us together again, perhaps we <i>had</i> better
understand each other. So you can come here this
evening for half-an-hour. I shall be alone. You had
better tap at the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> That'll do&mdash;I'll come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What time shall I have the honor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I'll get here about nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) Nine! You must make it earlier
than that. I expect I shall be rather busy about nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Eight-thirty then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes, that would suit me. (<i>crosses to porch and
then stops</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>turns and sees she is in hesitation</i>) Is there
anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>to him</i>) As you seem to

break through a rule for once&mdash;and turn up in a possible

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Not come drunk&mdash;is that what you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, I don't want to be unreasonable. At that

try not to be <i>too</i> drunk to be coherent. I'll expect you
at eight-thirty. (<i>she goes up stage, stands at kitchen

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Sweets, Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Quite ready! (<i>clearing tray of chicken dish
and plates</i>) They seem to have taken very kindly to
the stuffed fowls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Oh, horful! There's 'ardly a gizzard left for
hus to make a supper of. Dorvaston's the worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>at dresser</i>) Oh, and master too. (<i>takes
plates</i>) I thought he'd 'ave bust 'imself&mdash;I did reelly.
(<i>crosses to top of</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span>, <i>places plates on butler's tray</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> They told me to look sharp. It's wonderful
they don't want a rest. (<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>holds up dish of
fruit salad</i>; <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>takes dish in both hands admiringly;

looks lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Glad you like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>takes up tray</i>) It ain't no good <i>me</i> likin' it,
I shan't get none&mdash;they'll see to that. (<i>moves to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>
<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>moves to follow him</i>) Keziah, don't you come.
You'll never wait at table&mdash;your mind can't rise above
'anding bread when nobody wants it. (<i>she returns to

It <i>do</i> look lovely. Let's pray to 'eaven they don't eat
it all. (<i>he goes out</i>; <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>crosses to larder with chicken

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>at top of table clearing</i>) Gandy's a bit narked
to-night. (<i>rubs knives with a piece of rag</i>) When
there's a bit of anythink extra for supper, 'e does grodge
it to 'em, don't 'e? Now with me it's, as you may say,
different. If any trifle takes me fancy&mdash;such as a breast
of chicken&mdash;or what not&mdash;while it's bein' carved I simply
turn me 'ead away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table arranging plates</i>) Take these plates

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Yus, Cook. Not as it always answers. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Yus, Cook, that was it&mdash;in a butter boat. Well,
I was 'anding it to old Madam as the Captain cut himself
off&mdash;oh, such a slice of 'am&mdash;I dote on 'am, I do,
reelly. Well, I had to shet me eyes, and just then
Gandy hustled me with 'is elbow, and me wrist turned,
as you may say, sudden like, and I upset the myanneasy
on to milady's gown. She did talk to me a treat. (<i>takes
fish plates to scullery</i>; <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters hastily, stands</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Now then, Keziah, one claret glass short.

glass and hands it to</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <span class="smcap">R.</span>; <i>then returns to dresser
for plates</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Do they seem to fancy the fruit salad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Fancy it! Dorvaston and the governor are
both in their second 'elpings. It's 'ideous to see 'em&mdash;'ideaous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>at dresser</i>) I shall be awful late with me
washin' up. (<i>crosses to window with plates</i>) I shall
miss a good 'alf of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>crosses to larder for cheese</i>) I'll wash the
glass and silver for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>crosses to top of table and takes chicken plates
to scullery, leaving four forks on table</i>) That's wonderful
good of you, Cook; it is reelly. D'you know I'm
in two minds which 'at to wear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Are you? (<i>crosses from larder to table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>with
cheese, places it at top of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>fingering top of chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) The straw's tasty;
but the large 'at with the flowers is more dressy like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I wouldn't wear the large one with the flowers.
(<i>returning to larder for butter</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Wouldn't you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>stops on her way to larder</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) It might have
been made in the Old Kent Road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Might it, now? Is that in London? (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table with butter, and
stands at the head</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> At the shop where I bought it, they told me as
it was copied from a London pattern, so I dessay you're
right, Cook. Well, I could wear the straw, but&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span>
<i>enters with tray</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>rises, crosses to window ledge
for cheese plates</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>speaking sadly</i>) Now then, cheese&mdash;cheese.
(<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>is at top of table clearing butler's tray</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I see they've finished the fruit salad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Finished it! Of course they've finished it.
It's 'eartbreakin'. Put the dish away, and let me try
to forget it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>comes down to table</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) 'As the Governor

I could wear the straw, only I'm wishful to look me
best, cos the young gentleman as I'm walkin' out with
at present'll be there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh! (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table, takes cloth out of

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> We shan't be able to sit together, cos of old

come after the place&mdash;"I don't allow no followers"&mdash;You
know 'er sniffy way? (<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>takes plates to scullery,

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>puts cloth on table, crosses to mantel and gets
matches off bracket</i>) What does your young gentleman
do when he isn't following?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Didn't I tell you? (<i>comes back to table</i>) 'E's
at Bilkins, (<i>sits on table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) the pork butchers. You
remember that pound of sausages that came from me
aunt at Cambridge? (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>nods</i>) That was 'im&mdash;'e
began with sausages&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>lights gas over stove</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)

may say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> He must be. (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Won't you be feelin' lonesome (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>lights gas</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and leaves match-box on dresser</i>) this evenin'? All
of us out&mdash;and Gandy goin' to see 'is mother. She lives
two stations down the line and used to take in washin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, I don't fancy I shall feel lonesome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> I'll (<i>jumps off table, comes round and sits on
chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and gets book out of drawer</i>) lend you my
girl's "Special Monthly Journal." There's a most <i>interestin'</i>
tale in this number. It's in 'ere. There's an <i>'url</i>
and 'e goes ridin' through a wood and 'e's all dressed
up in armour, you know&mdash;just like the dish covers.
(<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>crosses to window, gets knife basket and comes
down to top of table</i>) I say, Cook, when you lived in
London did <i>you</i> ever see any 'urls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> One or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> And do they dress themselves up like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not as a rule. (<i>cleaning spoons and putting
them in basket</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> My word, I wish I'd bin born a toff! They
must find life come easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>at top of table</i>) Not always. Trouble is like
a postman&mdash;sooner or later he knocks at <i>every</i> door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Why, they can eat and drink just what they
like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. After a time their doctors have a word
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> And they can wear just what suits 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> They wear whatever their dressmakers and tailors
tell them to wear&mdash;whether it suits them or not. It
generally doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Any'ow they don't 'ave to pay for their breakages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> In the long run they pay just as heavily
for their breakages as you do for yours. (<i>crosses
and replaces basket on window ledge and comes
down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> My word! Think of that now! (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> That's over. (<i>sits</i>) I'm fair sick of it. The
governor is rushin' on to 'is fate. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>takes off the
bread, cheese and glasses and puts them on lower end

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> I've done most of the clearin' away. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Keziah</span>) Bring me the bowl, Keziah, and
then you can put your things on. (<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>crosses to

have your supper now? (<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>brings hot water to

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> No, thank'ee. They've put me off it. I shall
try to pick a bit by and bye when I get to mother's.</p>

<i>of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> No, she ain't; far from it! 'Er jints are flabby,
and 'er pie crust is h'ashfelt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> (<i>coming out of larder</i>) Is there anything
more, Cook, as I can do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, thanks. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>takes plates into scullery</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Good night, Gandy. (<i>crosses to door</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Not so much Gandy! <i>Mr.</i> Gandy would do you

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>takes bread to larder top way and returns

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly! (<i>washing glasses</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> But before I go to-night, I should like 'alf a
word with you about a little matter which 'as bin
floatin' on the top of my mind for this month past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Won't it keep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> No, it won't&mdash;not if you was to put it in the

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> People change their minds sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> I shan't change my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well, change your coat, or you'll miss your

one&mdash;and&mdash;that's how it was, don't you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Cook gave you an orchid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No, a light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Then why allude to an orchid? However, it is
quite immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You said you wished to speak to me, Mr. Pillenger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>coming a little to her</i>) I desired to express
my approval&mdash;my warm approval&mdash;of the excellent meal
you gave us this evening; but I fear I have not sufficient
time to do justice to the theme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<span class="smcap">R.</span>) By George, sir, you did justice to the
fruit salad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Very possibly, Captain Dorvaston, but I may remind
you that your own appreciation assumed a very
practical form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Won't you both be rather late? (<i>they both look
at each other and then go up to the door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>turning at garden door</i>) I fear we shall. I
may have to return early&mdash;I am conscious of the approach
of a headache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Deuced odd thing! I feel a bit off colour&mdash;doubt
if I shall manage to see it through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut! you look singularly well! Merely
fancy, I'm sure. (<i>opens door</i>) Good-night, Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Good-night! (<span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>goes out at back door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>following</i>) Good-night, Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Good-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>turning at door and speaking in whisper</i>)
Nine-thirty! (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>nods&mdash;he goes out. After a second</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>puts his head in at the window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Cook! you remember our appointment? Nine
o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>in the distance</i>) Are you coming, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) Yes&mdash;in one moment! (<i>to</i>
<span class="smcap">Cook</span>) Nine! you quite understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>calmly</i>) Quite!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Thank you. I thought I would just recall it to
your memory. I'm coming, Captain Dorvaston! (<i>he
goes</i>; <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>continues her work</i>; <span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>, <i>is
crossing to door, stops, comes to top of table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>; <i>he has
changed his dress and carries a small hand-bag; he
puts this down and his hat, and hastily consults silver
watch</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Cook, I'm a leetle pressed for time&mdash;but I find
I've just got three minutes and a 'alf to waste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well, what is it? (<i>washing glasses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> I'll come straight to the pint. I've saved money&mdash;I'm
sick of service, and I want to settle down. I
know of a eatin' 'ouse to be 'ad&mdash;good situation&mdash;terms
moderate&mdash;part cash down&mdash;remainder in monthly instalments.
Will you marry me and take over the kitchen
department?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>crosses to oven and kneels and opens it</i>)
Don't be 'asty now. We should crush all local competition.
Think it over careful. (<i>looks at his watch
again</i>) I can give you a minute and a 'alf. I'm a staid
respectable man, and I want a staid respectable wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>kneeling at oven</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <i>looks over her shoulder</i>)
And do I strike you in that light?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> You do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That is a very unexpected compliment. (<i>rises,
places cake on table</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>comes down to chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Yes, Cook; since I
met you I've come to see there's things in life as I
didn't suspect. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>stops work</i>) You've showed me
the superiority of braized beef over biled beef&mdash;you've
rewealed the difference between 'aricot and 'ash&mdash;before
you came apple fritters was to me a mere flash
in the frying pan. (<i>suddenly stopping and looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
his watch</i>) Now I wouldn't 'urry you, but time's on
the move. 'Ow's it to be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It's to be no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I wish the eating-house every success, but I
don't intend to marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> But couldn't you&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, I couldn't. Don't miss your train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Well, (<i>takes up bag and hat</i>) it's a disappointment,
but if you say it's to be like that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It's to be like that. (<i>she resumes her work</i>)
Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>goes slowly up stage, pauses, turns&mdash;is about
to speak, thinks better of it</i>) Good-night. (<i>he goes out
at back door.</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>takes cake to larder, and then
crosses back to window, brings glass tray down to top
of table and puts glasses on it</i>. <span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>rushes in after
a slight pause, hastily dressed for walking, with large
hat trimmed lavishly with flowers</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Ready at last, Cook! I'm always a cow's tail,
ain't I? Thought I should never get into this dress.
Miss Fletcher sent it 'ome so tight, I can't 'ardly bear
myself, and no 'ook and eye at the neck, if you please.
(<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) Lend us a pin, there's a dear! (<span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>gives her one, and stands watching her</i>) Thanks!
(<i>crosses to looking-glass on wall</i>, <span class="smcap">R. U. E.</span>, <i>and fastens
her collar with pin</i>.) I'll talk to me lady when I pay
'er. (<i>turning sees</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>looking at her</i>) You're looking
at the 'at? Yus, I 'ad to wear the big one, the straw
didn't go with this dress, (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) It made me look
almost common like. Well, I must step it. (<i>goes up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You've forgotten your gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Got 'em in my pocket&mdash;can't put 'em on yet&mdash;me
hands is too 'ot. Am I all right at the back? This
skirt seems to kick up. (<i>turns her back to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, <i>and
kicks her foot up at the same time at back, looking
over shoulder</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not more than it does in front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> That's a blessing. (<i>opens door</i>) 'Arry war!
(<i>she goes, leaving back door open.</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>takes glass
tray to window, crosses and shuts door</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>; <i>crosses and
takes bowl to scullery, pours out water and wipes her
hands, gets plate basket (chimes strike three-quarters)

exit. There is a slight pause, then</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>looks in at
window, he taps twice, then whistles softly&mdash;there is
another slight pause, then</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>comes back and crosses</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>at window</i>) Oh! there you are! Anybody
about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. Come in, the door is open. (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>,
<i>he enters</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Well, I've got here. (<i>he stands leaning against
the door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> So I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> There's a beast of a dog somewhere on the
premises, ain't there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes, but he's chained up, and he's rather particular
about his food; you needn't be nervous. (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>slams door and crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>looking round kitchen</i>) And these are your
quarters, are they? You've brought your pigs to a nice
market. (<i>she is silent</i>) Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Why don't you speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I was waiting for you to begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Don't you feel the damned degradation of your
position?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. You seem to forget I was your wife for
nearly ten years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Ah! Have you any whiskey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>seeing decanter on slab in window</i>) Why,
what's this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That belongs to Captain Dorvaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> That's all right. (<i>crosses to window</i>) He
knows me. He won't mind. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L. Cray</span> <i>stands
at window with whiskey, syphon, and glass in hand</i>) A
cook! That's what beats me. Why a cook?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It was an experiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> If you were broke (<i>comes to top of table and
pours out whiskey</i>) why didn't you try the stage? The
divorce would have given you a leg up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> How did you find me out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Accident! (<i>takes a drink and crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I
came down here because I thought your pal the Duchess
might give me the straight tip as to your whereabouts.
My spottin' you was a bit of luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You must be very hard up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh! it's bin a rotten season! Nothin's paid
me. Had some big stable information for Doncaster
week&mdash;that didn't pay me, couldn't even win place
money. Tried the Stock Exchange; damned if that paid
me&mdash;jumped in at the top of the market, crawled out
at the bottom. (<i>crosses to chair</i>) Then there was the
trial&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Ah! I suppose the law expenses were heavy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh, devilish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Bribing the servants must have been rather a
serious item!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> What d'ye mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That was a most elaborate story my maid
Thompson told the jury&mdash;Thompson was not very intelligent.
It must have involved a great deal of careful
rehearsal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> We needn't go into all that. (<i>puts glass on
table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You are astonished to find me here. What did
you think I should do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Thought you were with Carruthers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, you didn't. (<i>he looks at her, tries to brave
it out, but his eyes fall</i>) You had been dangling your
title before the eyes of a certain rich widow, but I see
by the papers (<i>he pours out whiskey</i>) she has slipped
through those shaking fingers of yours and is going to
marry another man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>taking up glass nervously and drinking</i>)
Yes; women are damned shifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Your notion didn't come off, but that was why
you trumped up your case against me, knowing it was
all a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> You didn't deny it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Neither did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. Bob is a good fellow&mdash;and a good friend.
He helped me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Helped you to cheat the law!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Helped me to cheat the law that ties a woman
to such a man as you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> That was the game, was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Why did you want to find me out? By the way,
(<i>crosses to window and brings down "Standard" to
top of table</i>), has that anything to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>watching him closely</i>) To-day's "Standard."
There's a little advertisement in the agony column.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I&mdash;can't see&mdash;light's bad. Read it out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>crosses to gas</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <i>takes paper and reads</i>)
"Will Lady Huntworth communicate with Messrs.
Brampton and Stokes, Capel-Court, on a matter of considerable
importance?" (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table and
throws paper down</i>) Did you know of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> No. Who are Brampton and Stokes? Never
heard of 'em.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>leaning over table with one hand on it for support</i>)
Then why have you been hunting me up? I
hadn't a shilling&mdash;you saw to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>after slight pause, makes to touch her hand</i>)
I wanted you to&mdash;come&mdash;back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I'm willin'&mdash;to bury the past. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>looks at
him</i>) Well, I tell you, I want to bury the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>pause, she puts hand on chair</i>) Before we
talk of burying the past, I should like you to look down
into the still open grave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>shudders</i>) Filthy way of talkin'!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) When I married you I was thirty&mdash;quite
old enough to know better! but I'd spent my youth
in nursing my father. When he died I inherited a
fortune&mdash;and my freedom&mdash;without much notion what
to do with either. That was a bad year for me. I lost
my father and I found you. (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>scowls at her</i>)
I don't know what crime I had committed that fate
should sentence me to ten years' penal servitude. But
my father had wished it and so did your mother. You
had been a little wild, they said, but all you needed was
gentle guidance. I believed them, but my gentle guidance
that was to work miracles generally took the
shape of helping you up to bed in the small hours, when
the difficulty of adjusting the latchkey had been overcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Look here, it 'pears to me you're trying to be
'fensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That was my life for ten years. The dregs of
your fortune and the whole of mine gradually melted
away&mdash;in cards&mdash;(<i>he pours out drink</i>) racing, drink&mdash;and
a few extra establishments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> You never grumbled about th' extra 'stablishments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>rises in disgust</i>) Oh, no! I only mention
them now&mdash;to fill up the picture of our home life. With
regard to your gambling and drunkenness I was sorry
for myself, but in the matter of your infidelities I was
sorry for the other women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Your language's 'fensive&mdash;damned 'fensive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> At the finish we had a pleasant little chat; you
hadn't a sixpence left&mdash;or a friend either&mdash;except Bob
Carruthers. He had lent you more than he could afford
and he was sick of it. You tried to get me to ask him
again. I wouldn't. It was on that occasion you reached
up and tried to strike me. (<i>touches him on shoulder</i>)
Do you remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Momentary irritation&mdash;regretted it d'rectly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>returns paper to window</i>) We parted that
night. The place was sold up, and I didn't hear of you
again till you commenced proceedings for our divorce.
(<i>he moves chair and faces her</i>) Then I went to Bob.
He offered to see me through&mdash;engage counsel and all
that. It would have been easy to smash your case,
(<i>crosses and stands over him</i>) but that would have left
me tied to you; so I asked him if he would join me in
making no defence. He pointed out what society would
think of me. I said I knew enough of society to care
nothing for its bad opinion. He did as I wished, so
you got your decree nisi and the sympathy of the public.
(<i>crosses to top of table again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> All this is beastly 'fensive. (<i>leans limply over
back of chair</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> My only problem was how to live. I couldn't
teach or make dresses or typewrite. There was only
one thing I could do properly&mdash;I could cook. It was
always a fad of mine. I used often to prepare little
dishes for my father&mdash;in the old days&mdash;and while I was
trying to see my way, I met Millicent Sturton. I told
her everything, and asked her to help me. She had
influence with these good people&mdash;so I resumed my own
name and became the vicar's cook. (<i>pause</i>; <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>has
gradually crossed</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>again</i>. <span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>moves chair back
to table and drinks</i>) Now you understand everything!
I'll say good-bye. I'm likely to be rather busy this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Don't say goo'bye. I wan' you to come back.
My 'ntentions are disin'ersted. Won't you come
back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>stands with hands behind her back</i>) Not
while there's a crossing to be swept&mdash;or a box of
matches to be sold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>rising unsteadily&mdash;leaning over table</i>)
S'pose I was to&mdash;give th' show away&mdash;d'you think they'd
keep a woman like you&mdash;a woman who was n'torious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Very well, then I can squash you. Word from
me'd sweep you into the gutter&mdash;an' if you don' come
back&mdash;I'll do it. I'll show you what comes of r'fusin'
disin'ested offer. (<i>she laughs and shrugs her shoulders</i>)
Don' laugh at me, you fool! I'll do it! I'll drag you
off your damned high horse, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;(<i>raises his arm
to strike her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, you won't! (<i>pauses; his arm slowly falls
and he sways about limply</i>) you're too anxious to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
your own identity secret just now to say anything
about mine. Isn't that so&mdash;Mr. Crayll?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>swaying about</i>) Tha's true, tha's true! Le's
be frien's&mdash;shall we? Don' le's be touchy. If you'll
come back, I'll do the right thing&mdash;marry you again&mdash;marry
you anywhere you like&mdash;St. Paul's Cathedral, if
you like. Come back and be a comfort to ailin' man.
(<i>sinks into chair</i>) Le's have 'nother honeymoon. Shall
we? Le's kiss an' be friends; but first le's have a little
more whiskey. (<i>taking whiskey</i>) Shall we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>removing the tumbler, etc.</i>) No, we won't
have any more whiskey&mdash;in fact, I think we had better
go now. (<i>she takes whiskey syphon and glass to window,
and looks out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>who is now maudlin</i>) Not friendly! No
r'sumption of former 'fectionate footin', same time&mdash;no
desire to remain&mdash;where not wanted. (<i>puts cap on</i>)
Where's cigar case? Want cigar&mdash;smoke going home.
(<i>he very sleepily takes out letter case from his outside
pocket</i>) Oh, here 'tish! (<i>as he holds it, he begins to
doze, his arm falls its full length, and a letter falls out
of case&mdash;his head falls right back, and he breathes heavily.
He falls gradually into a deep sleep. She watches
him quietly, then comes round to the right of him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>pause</i>) Wake up! (<i>shakes him</i>) You mustn't
sleep here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>muttering</i>) Want cigar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Want a cigar? But this is your letter case.
(<i>she takes it from him, and puts it into his outside
pocket</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>She then sees the fallen letter</i>) And you've
dropped something. (<i>she picks it up&mdash;he snores</i>)
Looks like a writ. (<i>she glances at it</i>) Messrs. Brampton
and Stokes (<i>she pauses and looks at him</i>) Ah!
my first idea was right (<i>crosses to gas with letter round
to fireplace and reads it under the gas</i>) "Messrs.
Brampton and Stokes present their compliments to
Lord Huntworth, and would be greatly obliged if he
could place them in communication with the lady who
was till very recently his wife. The reason for the
application is urgent, as information has been received
from an Australian firm of solicitors that Lady Huntworth
has succeeded to a considerable fortune through
the death of an uncle. (<i>she again turns and looks at
him</i>) Messrs. Brampton and Stokes would greatly appreciate
an early reply. Capel Court. May 9th." More
than two months ago! Ah! (<i>slight pause, crosses to
top of table, and leans over it</i>) Lord Huntworth, you
will do me the favour to wake up. (<i>he snores</i>) I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
thought I had said everything I had to say, but I find I
was wrong. (<i>she stops and listens, then puts letter
hurriedly inside her dress</i>) What's that? Did I hear
the gate go? (<i>crosses to window, then crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>and shakes him and pulls him up</i>) Wake up&mdash;you
mustn't be found here. (<i>she pulls him up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Wha's matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I must put you somewhere; you wouldn't be
easy to explain away. (<i>she half-supports, half-carries
him up and into scullery; when there she allows him
to droop into a sitting position against the sink; she
then shuts the scullery door</i>) Quite like old times!
(<i>looks out of window&mdash;brings work-box down, goes up
to door and listens.</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>enters</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hum! Cook! (<i>at door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> May I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly! (<i>crosses to chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and sits, takes
out pudding cloth and starts to hem it</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>enters at back door</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;explained to Miss Pillenger that I
thought it advisable to return home early&mdash;as I was
feeling somewhat indisposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>looks up at him</i>) Then you would like to go
to bed? I'll let Miss Pillenger in. (<i>looks at door</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> That is not necessary, I gave her my latchkey.
I fear I must admit my illness has no&mdash;er&mdash;tangible existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I trust I am not interrupting any&mdash;er&mdash;domestic
occupation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I have to hem some pudding cloths, but I can
listen while I work. What do you want to say to me?
(<i>she begins sewing</i>; <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>crosses to top of table,
puts hat down; as he crosses</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>looks at door</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;find some difficulty in approaching the
subject. It is one with which I have been hitherto&mdash;quite
unfamiliar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Perhaps if you sat down it might be easier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Er&mdash;thank you. (<i>crosses to fire and stands with
back to it</i>) The suggestion is very considerate. (<i>he
makes several efforts to begin, but baulks himself</i>)
During the few months you have been with us&mdash;you
must have noticed that you had roused&mdash;in me&mdash;a strong
feeling&mdash;(<i>she looks up at him</i>) of&mdash;er&mdash;of interest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I saw it&mdash;I didn't notice it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Exactly! (<i>moves to back of chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) You
would not&mdash;care&mdash;perhaps, to give me a somewhat larger
measure of your&mdash;er&mdash;confidence&mdash;touching the&mdash;er&mdash;the
past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>stops work for a moment</i>) No; I think we'll
leave the past alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I may possibly persuade you to be less reticent&mdash;when
I have submitted my&mdash;er&mdash;my proposal to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Proposal? (<i>resumes work</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes. After such reasonable hesitation as should
precede the taking of any important step, I have decided
to offer you an alternative to your present life,
the nature of which you may have already guessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiling back</i>) I suppose <i>you</i> are the alternative?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>moves to top of table near her</i>) Precisely. I
ask you to be&mdash;er&mdash;to be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiles</i>) Thanks! (<i>stops work</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I am no longer young, but my health is good,
with the exception of a little periodic gout. My temper,
if not invariably equable, is what a long succession
of curates has made it; and as to worldly considerations,
without being a rich man, my position is an independent
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You say you don't speak without consideration.
Have you considered what your sister would say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>moves round to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) It is a point to which I
have devoted very exhaustive attention. At first she
might not welcome the idea with&mdash;er&mdash;absolute enthusiasm.
(<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, she might not. Have you also considered
what the world would say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It's rather a tolerant world where a man is
concerned, but it holds special views about clergymen,
and it wouldn't stand the notion of a vicar marrying his
cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The social disparity between us is far more
apparent than real. Your present vocation must be the
outcome of caprice&mdash;or temporary necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Take it at that. (<i>puts work in box</i>) What do
you know of me? I may be an adventuress&mdash;in fact,
most of the evidence points that way. At any rate I
have no intention of marrying. (<i>smiles</i>) I have said
the same thing once before this evening in reply to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
similar proposition from Gandy. (<i>rises and crosses
back of her chair and leans on chair</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Gandy? Did he dare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> He did. (<i>smiling</i>) This seems to be rather a
susceptible household. (<i>crosses to window and looks
out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>rising</i>) You haven't given me a conclusive
answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>hearing footsteps</i>) Haven't I? I thought I
had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) You may require a little time
for final reflection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I think not. (<i>looking out of window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Nevertheless, if you will spare me your attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> One moment! I thought I heard a step on the
path. (<i>she looks out of window</i>) Yes, it's Captain Dorvaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crosses to door and looks out, returns and takes
hat from table</i>) You don't say so? That is highly
inconvenient. What had I better do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I think you had better go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> An opportunity like the present is so difficult
to obtain. He will merely pass through to his room.
I'll wait in the scullery. (<i>makes for it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>puts hand on door</i>) The scullery is rather in
confusion. (<i>goes back to window and looks out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Then the larder is probably available. (<i>goes towards
it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I really wouldn't wait if I were you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>speaking from entrance to larder</i>) I do so on
my own initiative. There are several arguments I wish
to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>at window</i>) He's coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Oh! (<i>hastily goes in and closes larder door</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>simultaneously enters at garden door</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well, Cook, I've got back. May I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> If you like. (<i>drops down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>enters
and locks door after him</i>) You needn't have locked
the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Don't you keep it locked?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I do generally&mdash;it doesn't matter. (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> The governor was seedy and left early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes, he came back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Gone to bed, I s'pose? (<i>she is silent and has resumed
her work</i>) I tried to think of something a bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
more novel, but I couldn't, so I had to tell the old lady
I wasn't feeling fit myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Why did you trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>crosses to top of table and puts hat down</i>) Oh,
well, don't you know, I wanted to say something to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. (<i>stops work</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I'm a bad hand at getting my notions into
words. P'raps if you go on doing&mdash;whatever you're doing&mdash;I
may manage to make a start. (<i>she resumes work</i>)
That ought to look exceptional pretty when it's finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes! What&mdash;is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> A pudding cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Jove! You don't say so? (<i>laughs</i>) I say, you
mustn't think me an awful ass!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It doesn't matter what I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It matters to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It oughtn't to matter. (<i>pause&mdash;he takes up the
weekly journal</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Been doing a bit of reading? (<i>sits on table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>
<i>corner</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. That belongs to Keziah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> This sounds promising. (<i>reads</i>) "The belted
Earl entered the lists with lance in rest. His shield
bore for device a bar sinister with Fleur de Lys rampant."
That ain't heraldry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes, it is, (<i>looking up</i>) "Family Heraldry."
(<i>he laughs</i>) I don't want to hurry you, but it's getting
late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Well, I&mdash;I hope you haven't misunderstood
my&mdash;object in&mdash;bothering you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I should like to think I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I don't follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Members of your profession don't generally
make an appointment with cook in order to assure her
of their respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Some of us may be a bit rackety, but we know
a lady when we see one, and we shouldn't treat her
any different because she chose to pretend to be a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Pretend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and gets gradually to chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of
table</i>) Why, any duffer could see&mdash;<i>I</i> can see you were
never meant to be what you are. These things generally
come about through loss of coin&mdash;for instance,
a woman's father speculates, and the home goes biff.
He shuts up in his stride, and she takes up the running.
Now what that woman wants is a friend to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
her the lead over the fences&mdash;a friend who don't want
anything from her&mdash;will you keep your eye on that?&mdash;who
don't want anything from her, but who would like
awfully to do her a turn, if she'd let him. I think that
goes into the four corners of what I wanted to say.
(<i>sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Do you know you're a wonderfully
good fellow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh, rot! Well, may I be&mdash;a little use to somebody
for once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I won't borrow money of you, if you meant
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> False pride!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, that isn't it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It's a devilish odd thing that every good woman
is a bit of a coward, and she's always afraid of what
people will say, especially if it isn't true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That description fits me less than any woman in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You won't let me be of use to you, because I
happen to be a man, and you happen to be a woman&mdash;ain't
that so? (<i>rises</i>) I see how it is. I've made an
ass of myself. You won't have my help or my friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>rises</i>) I don't need the help, but I'll take the
friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>shuts work-box</i>) What I thought about you
was wrong. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh, that's all right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>leans on box</i>) Now, will you do me a little
favour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Anything! (<i>leans over table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Will you go to bed? (<i>he backs with surprise</i>)
They mustn't come back and find you here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Of course not, I'll go at once; and if at any
time you should want a pal, you'll let me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Hush! (<i>crosses to door and opens it</i>) I fancy
I heard the key in the front door. (<i>she listens</i>) Yes,
it is them. Miss Pillenger is saying she wants to speak
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>takes up hat</i>) By George! I'd better nip into
the scullery. (<i>crosses to scullery</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> The larder? (<i>crosses to it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. Go into the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Of course! Stupid of me! (<i>he tries the door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Make haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Can't get the beastly door open. Something's
wrong with the key.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You'll be too late! (<i>advances towards him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Here! (<i>opens door</i>) What's this? Ah, the
broom cupboard, any port in a storm! (<i>goes in</i>; <span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>shuts door and stands there for a moment</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>enters</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Cook, I remembered I hadn't ordered to-morrow's
breakfast. (<i>crosses and sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. What would you like? (<i>crosses to top of
table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>sitting</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table</i>) Has Keziah returned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Both my brother and Captain Dorvaston were
too unwell to remain with us. They have doubtless gone
to bed, so I will ask you to go upstairs very quietly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Certainly! I think I hear Keziah. (<i>she goes
to back-door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> She is very late. (<i>pause</i>) Why don't you
open the door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The key sticks a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> It should be oiled. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>opens the door and
admits</i> <span class="smcap">Keziah</span>, <i>who doesn't see</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Oh, Cook, I did enjoy myself a treat! 'E was
there&mdash;and when I come out&mdash;&mdash; (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and sees</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Pillenger</span>) Oh lor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Keziah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Yes, mum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Why are you so late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> I dunno, mum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Who is the person you spoke of when you
came in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> What person, mum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You said distinctly <i>he</i> was there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Oh, that was me sister's 'usband's brother, mum.
(<i>winks at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) 'E's a plumber, and Church of England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You are aware I don't allow followers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> 'E don't follow <i>me</i>, mum. I did give 'im good
evenin', bein', as you may say, relations, and 'e told me
as my sister 'as just 'ad 'er <i>seventh</i>, and both doin' well,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> That will do. I hope you are telling the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Oh yes, mum, it's gorspel, it is reely!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Mind you go upstairs quietly; your master
is unwell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kez.</span> Yes, mum. (<i>goes to door again, winks at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>)
Good night, mum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Good night! (<span class="smcap">Keziah</span> <i>goes out</i>) I'm afraid,
Cook, you must have had a rather dull evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No, I haven't been dull. (<i>puts box on window-ledge
and returns</i>) You were going to speak about the
breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Yes. Let me see, we shall have fish. (<i>noise
in cupboard</i>) What was that? I heard a noise in that
cupboard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It may have been a mouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I didn't know we had any mice. You had
better set a trap to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You mentioned fish? Will you have it grilled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> No, fried with egg and breadcrumbs. (<i>noise
in cupboard is repeated more loudly</i>) That can't be
a mouse. The cat must have got shut up in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The cat is in the scullery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Then it must be a strange cat. (<i>rises and
crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>going to cupboard, her hand on knob</i>) Strange
cats sometimes fly at you. If you'll go, I'll see to it.
I'm not nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>advances to cupboard</i>) Neither am I. I
prefer to see for myself. (<i>waves</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>back</i>) How this
door sticks. (<i>she pulls at the handle of the door, which
at last opens, discovering</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) Captain Dorvaston!
(<i>he comes out sheepishly; pause</i>) May I ask you
to explain this? (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>looks first at</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> <i>then
at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>&mdash;<i>takes his hat off</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well, ma'am, it ain't exactly easy to make the
thing clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I see. (<i>speaking at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) The explanation
is only too obvious. My niece has gone to her room,
so I shall not disturb her to-night, but to-morrow it will
be my painful duty to tell her everything. (<i>moves a
step to the door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I say, ma'am, just a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>moves toward</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>and stops</i>) As to you,
Cook, I will&mdash;or, rather, Mr. Pillenger&mdash;will speak to
you in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) Very well! (<i>at top of table.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Pillenger</span> <i>moves to go</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>intercepts her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Look here, ma'am&mdash;upon my soul you must
listen. I wanted to say something to Cook. It was nothing&mdash;anybody
might have heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Then why conceal yourself in the broom
cupboard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I know the broom cupboard ain't easy to get
out of. I could explain better, only I feel in such an
awful hat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You are not wearing your hat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No, but&mdash;really, you know, I simply wanted&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Captain Dorvaston, don't trouble; whatever you
may say Miss Pillenger won't believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> That is true. There are things that cannot
be explained away. The broom cupboard is one of them.
(<i>going</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> But I say, ma'am! (<i>moves again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>motions him away</i>) Good-night, Captain
Dorvaston. (<i>he opens door, she goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>look at each other, she smiles</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>after pause</i>) I've made a nice mess of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You have rather. (<i>closes cupboard door, returns</i>
<span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> If nature allowed a fella to kick himself, I'd
do it with the greatest pleasure. (<i>comes to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and puts
hat down on table</i>) To drag you into such a beastly
muddle! And I did so want to do you a turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I know you did. You meant kindly, and I'm
very grateful. Go to bed and forget all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> There'll be an awful row to-morrow. I'm not
thinking of myself, I'm thinking about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You needn't worry about me. Oddly enough,
I've had news to-night that makes this affair very unimportant.
Now I must really ask you to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> All right, I'll be off. But, I say&mdash;you do forgive
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Of course I forgive you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Thanks. Good-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Good-night! (<i>he goes to door</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>, <i>then returns
to table for his hat. As he does so</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>cautiously
emerges from the larder. The two men face each other</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hum! Tut, tut! (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>turns and sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hulloa, sir! Were you in there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> What, all the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I had an important reason for desiring a few
minutes' conversation with&mdash;er&mdash;Cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Mr. Pillenger shared your wish that I should
better myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> That's devilish lucky, because, as you were a
witness, you can clean the slate for us, and back up
what I say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> You fail to perceive that my perfectly innocent
sojourn in the larder would be as difficult of plausible
explanation as your own regrettable occupancy of the
broom cupboard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Jove, yes, that's true! What had we better do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The first step&mdash;especially as you are both invalids
(<i>the men look at each other</i>) is for you to go to
bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> The suggestion is most judicious. (<i>they both
start for the door</i>; <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>stops Dorvaston</i>) I think,
Captain Dorvaston, I will precede you by a few minutes.
The stairs have a tendency to creak, and would certainly
do so under our combined weight. Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Good-night, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>is going but pauses</i>) With your permission
I will remove my boots. (<i>he does so</i>) It would not be
fair to disturb the household. Good-night! (<i>he goes
out with a boot in each hand, and his hat under his
arm</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>crosses and sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) By George! then the
governor was there all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes, I was well provided with chaperonage.
(<i>turns to mantel and puts gas out, takes candlestick
from bracket and crosses to window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It don't get you out of the mess, that's the worst
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>shutting the window and then crossing to
larder</i>) You needn't mind me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I'm bound to mind you. Are you sure there's
nothing I could do to help you&mdash;in any sort of way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. (<i>shuts door; her eye goes to scullery</i>)
Well, there is one thing you could do for me&mdash;if you
really mean what you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I swear I do! (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) What I should want you to do
would be rather a nuisance. Are you sure you wouldn't
mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Try me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well, there's a man in the scullery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Another man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. I fancy you'll find he is asleep against
the sink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Is he, by George?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Might I trouble you to fetch him out? (<i>crosses
to dresser and lights candle</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Eh? What? Oh, certainly! (<i>he goes to scullery,
opens door and discovers</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>asleep in a sitting

candle, and light falls on</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll's</span> <i>face</i>) Why, it's
Crayll! (<i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> He's as drunk as a fiddler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. He called on me this evening, rather to
my inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Might I ask you&mdash;to put him somewhere for me?
(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>looks at her wonderingly</i>) There's a dry
ditch&mdash;at the end of the garden&mdash;that would do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Anything you wish, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Thanks! (<i>turns</i> <span class="smcap">B.</span> <i>gas out</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Then you know Crayll?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) He was my husband
at one time. (<i>turns out gas</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>in an amazed whisper</i>) What!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The Vicarage Library (according to plan).</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time.</span>&mdash;<i>Early next morning.</i>
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Darling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Hush!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Mustn't I?&mdash;on our wedding day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> At least&mdash;whatever you wish to convey to me
must be done in dumb show.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I see. (<i>he kisses her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Mind my hat. (<i>looks off</i>) When we have
been married a few years you'll realize that my hats
must be treated very respectfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I suppose the household is still in bed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Yes. (<i>crosses to settle and sits on</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>end</i>) I
crept downstairs feeling like a burglar. I had one awful
moment&mdash;I stumbled over Auntie's shoes&mdash;they were outside
her door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> My dearest&mdash;that was rather careless. (<i>leans
on post</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Careless! Auntie's shoes aren't easy to avoid
in a narrow passage. It was all right. Uncle and Aunty
were still asleep&mdash;I could hear them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> And Captain Dorvaston?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh! I expect Jack was asleep, too, not dreaming
the hour of his emancipation was at hand. Poor old
Jack! I wish he was coming with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Hum! Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I wish he could have given me away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I&mdash;hardly share that feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You don't know him; he'd have done it in a
minute if I'd asked him. I'd have told him all about it,
only he's such a clumsy old duffer; he might have given
me away in a different sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> You seem to place great reliance on his affection
for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> He has tons of affection for me&mdash;tons&mdash;but not
love&mdash;at least, not the business article you and I deal
in. (<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>goes to embrace her, she waves him off</i>)
By the way, Harry, (<i>she is putting on her gloves</i>) there
are one or two points we have never properly settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> What are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I mean to be a clinking parson's wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Darling! (<i>moves to her, she waves him off
as before</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Hold on! I mean to be a clinking parson's
wife, but I have my limitations. Church on Sunday&mdash;how
many times?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>) Three?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, no! Mornings generally, evenings sometimes,
afternoons never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Never?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Never! (<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>moves to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>rises and
follows</i>) Now you're shocked&mdash;your face has grown a
couple of inches longer. Well, if I'm not orthodox
enough for you it's off, and I'll go back to bed again.
(<i>moves to go</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Lucy dear, (<i>catches her arm</i>) in answer to
what you said, I shall merely exact one promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Which is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> That in all things&mdash;and in all seasons&mdash;you
will do&mdash;or not do&mdash;whatever you please. Do you
promise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>after slight pause. She puts left hand on
shoulder</i>) Harry, I do promise; it shall be exactly as
you say. Indeed, indeed, I'll keep my word. Now then,
fasten my glove, and we'll go and get it over. (<i>he proceeds
to fasten her glove, as</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>enters, carrying
a small tray with coffee, bread and butter, etc.; she also
carries a large shoe under her arm</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>at top of stairs</i>) I beg your pardon. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>are much startled</i>. <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>moves away
towards table</i> <span class="smcap">R.C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Cook!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I hope I didn't startle you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Not at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>comes down, and stands at bottom of stairs</i>)
I thought you might like a cup of coffee (<i>smiling</i>) to
help you face the ordeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Was that why you wanted to know last night
what time I meant to start?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> No. I told you I wanted to think of you, and
wish you luck. The coffee was an afterthought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Won't you both sit down and have it comfortably?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Is it safe to wait? (<i>crosses up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and looks
off&mdash;anxiously</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Keziah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Keziah is not awake&mdash;I wrapped the alarum in
a blanket. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>crosses to top</i>; <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>; <span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>crosses to top of chair and puts tray on table and shoe
on chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>then sit</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> It has probably dawned on you, Harry, that
Cook is a good friend of ours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> It has, indeed! (<i>he rises, bows&mdash;sits again</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Cook was once young herself&mdash;it was some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
ago&mdash;but she hasn't forgotten the circumstances. (<i>to</i>
<span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) Milk and sugar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Thanks. (<i>she holds cup to her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Mr. Thorsby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> If you please&mdash;two lumps. (<i>she hands cup
to him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Bread and butter? (<i>they both take some</i>) It
isn't up to much&mdash;yesterday's loaf&mdash;but it was the best
I could do. And how do you both feel? Nervous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Beastly nervous! (<i>eating</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>eating</i>) The moment is naturally a solemn
one. I feel anxious, but not nervous. (<i>takes up cup
and drinks</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Oh, it's all right for you; you've tied up such
a lot of poor misguided people, that you know the words
backwards. It's different with me&mdash;I know I shall
bungle it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> There are only three words that really signify.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Which three?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Love, honor, and obey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> I think I can manage the first two, but I mean
to slur the third, (<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>drops cup in saucer</i>) cough,
or sneeze or something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>, <i>smiling</i>) That sounds rather
an alarming prospect. Don't you pity me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>glancing at</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, <i>and also smiling</i>) No, I
don't think I do. (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) How do you go to
Church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>rising</i>) We are going to bike there. By-the-bye,
would you tell somebody&mdash;Auntie or Jack&mdash;anybody
will do&mdash;that I've run over to see my friend, Jenny
Thornton, and they're not to wait breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>rising</i>) My dear Lucy, ought we to involve
a third person in our deception?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The third person hasn't a very tender conscience
in such matters. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) I'll tell your little
fib for you with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>leans over chair, sees shoe</i>) There, Harry,
I knew she would. Thank you, Cook. (<i>taking up the
shoe which</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>has placed on a chair</i>) What's this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) I wanted to throw a shoe after you, and
that was the only one I could find. It's one of your
Aunt's&mdash;she put it outside her door to be cleaned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Dear me! It looks rather formidable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It <i>is</i> large! We'll hope that the luck it brings
will be proportionate. Now, I should say it was time for
you to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>going up to window</i>) Yes, I don't think we
ought to delay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>puts shoe down again, crosses up to window,
and down to below table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) All right, come along.
Stop a second though. I say, Harry, have you got
everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>returns from</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Got everything? (<span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>crosses to back of table, and puts things on tray</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Everybody's fee. I should like to do the thing
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> How about the ring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Eh? Oh, yes, I&mdash;(<i>searching his pockets</i>) I
bought it yesterday. (<i>still searching</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> Very likely, but have you got it with you to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> I certainly think so. I have a distinct recollection
of putting it in my waistcoat pocket. (<i>still
searching</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> You've lost it. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) There's a pretty
mess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> Ah! here it is. (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) There
is a hole in the pocket, and it had slipped down into the
lining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) Thank goodness! That would
have been a nice thing, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>) Will you wear this? It's only
syringa, but it looks like orange blossom. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>exchange glances</i>) I picked it for you this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>fixing it</i>) You <i>have</i> been kind to me, and
I've no means of thanking you. Will you stoop down
and let me kiss you? (<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>does so</i>) I'm afraid that's
all I can do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I'm quite repaid. I fancy Mr. Thorsby agrees
with me. (<span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>crosses up to window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thor.</span> (<i>goes up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>a little; takes</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> <i>coat with
him</i>) Good-bye! May I add my thanks also?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Not at all. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy.</span> (<i>crosses down again to</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) It isn't good-bye&mdash;we're
coming back as soon as it's over; and we
mean to tell everything to everybody. So we shall see
you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> One never knows what may happen. I think
we'll make it good-bye. (<i>puts hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> <i>shoulder</i>)
Now, go along and get married, and live happy ever
after, as they do in the fairy tales. (<span class="smcap">Thorsby</span> <i>goes out
of the window</i>; <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>follows, but turns and kisses her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hand. They go</i>)</p>

<i>door</i>.)</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Hulloa! Good-morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>at top of table</i>) Good morning. Rather a
close shave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Nothing! (<i>is taking up tray</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>at top of table</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>) Look here, don't
go. I want to have half a word with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I&mdash;saw to that little job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I&mdash;put him in the ditch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Thanks. Did he say anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>top of table</i>) He muttered something about
another whiskey, and that he would like to be called
about nine. Now would you mind telling me a little
about it all? Give you my word it ain't mere curiosity,
it's interest in you and everything that concerns you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>at back of chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) I told you the chief thing
last night. Mr. Crayll was my husband at one time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You say he was your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. We are divorced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Oh, that was it! (<i>pause</i>) I haven't known
your&mdash;er&mdash;I haven't known Crayll more than a day or
two, but I can see he's an awful little swine. I suppose
he treated you anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. Is there anything else you would like me
to tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> It's extraordinary good of you to give me your
confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You've earned it. (<i>takes tray, and turns</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>crosses behind her, to her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Well then, I
say, what are you going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> See to the breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No, no! I mean about&mdash;Miss Pillenger&mdash;and&mdash;the
broom cupboard. There'll be an infernal row, and
I'm afraid you'll get beans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiles</i>) I'm used to handling all kinds of
vegetables. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>laughs too</i>) As I told you
last night, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>) But, by George, it <i>does</i> matter!
When I asked you then to let me be of use to you, I put
it to you as a favor, now I ask it as a right. I got you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
into this mess, simply through my beastly clumsiness,
and you've got to let me see you through it somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>back of table</i>) News has reached me, in rather
a roundabout way, that I have come into some money;
so you see I'm independent&mdash;of Miss Pillenger&mdash;and the
broom cupboard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You're not&mdash;pulling my leg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Then I'm devilish glad for your sake, and devilish
sorry for my own. I thought at last I saw my way&mdash;to
doing you a turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>places her hand on chair at back of</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)
My life hasn't been a very pleasant one, but in one respect
I've been lucky, I have known two men who honestly
tried to befriend a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Who was the other chap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> His name is Carruthers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Not old Bob? (<i>rises and backs</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>affirmatively</i>) Old Bob.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Why, he's a dear pal of mine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> And did he try to be a pal to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I was thinking of his kindness to Lady Huntworth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Ah, how about Lady Huntworth? Did you
know her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes! (<i>smiling</i>) We are rather intimate&mdash;like
myself she was unfortunate in her choice of a husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Huntworth brought the divorce, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. Thinking he saw his way to marrying
another woman, with another fortune, he brought his
suit against his wife and your friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Damn him! Pardon! couldn't help it. (<i>crosses
and kneels on chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> The whole thing was utterly untrue and I know
she asked Bob to join her in making no defence rather
than remain Lady Huntworth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> The only thing that rather fogs me is, when
the verdict was once given, why didn't Bob marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> He did suggest it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> She said no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Why did she do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>rises, crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Still, it was game of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to refuse! There ain't many women placed as she was
who'd have done it. (<i>goes up and leans on balustrade,

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Perhaps not. (<i>pause&mdash;takes up tray and crosses</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span>; <i>as she moves</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>turns and places hand on

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No, wait one minute. I'm going on duty directly.
My duty is to make Lucy a happy little woman
and I mean to do it. But you seem to be going down
rather a lonely road and I want you to remember that
somewhere or other there is an old duffer lumbering
about the world who will never forget you&mdash;will you
remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I shall remember. (<i>pulls tray away</i>) Now I
really can't stay any longer. (<i>crosses to first step</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>holding out his hand</i>) I say! (<i>she turns&mdash;places
tray on balustrade</i>) Will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Of course! Why not? (<i>they shake hands</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Supposing I'd been a free man, do you think
you&mdash;could&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh! (<i>draws hand away and takes up tray,
moves to second step</i>) That opens out a very large
question. I haven't time to answer that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>touches her on shoulder, she turns</i>) I wonder
if we shall ever come across each other in the future?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>looking at him</i>) More unlikely things have
happened. (<i>mounts third step, turns to him</i>) Good-bye!

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Eh? Hum&mdash;yes. The razor slipped. My nervous

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> The result of last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>startled</i>) Last night? I&mdash;er&mdash;fail to understand
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I was referring to your indisposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Are you going out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I thought the fresh morning air might be beneficial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I must ask you to remain. I have a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
painful subject to talk over with you. (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Need we deal with it now? Painful subjects

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crosses to chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Scandal! I trust, Hannah,
you are weighing your words very carefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I am not in the habit of speaking heedlessly.
What I have to tell you refers to Cook&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>

in his hand</i>)&mdash;and to Captain Dorvaston.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>enters smoking</i>.)
</p>

<i>is in the room</i>. <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>throws cigarette away

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am!
(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>bows frigidly</i>. <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>crosses to
chair</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah was just&mdash;er&mdash;mentioning, as you entered,
that&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>quietly beating the back of chair with shoe</i>)
Yes, I fancied I caught my name. What were you saying,
ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I was saying, Captain Dorvaston&mdash;&mdash; (<i>she
notices the shoe</i>) What are you doing with that shoe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Just picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Why did you touch it? Your doing so seems
to me to be strangely wanting in delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Don't see anything indelicate in picking up an
old shoe. I found it on the garden path.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> My shoe on the garden path!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yours! I thought it was Gandy's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> If you thought to keep me a prisoner in my
room by the removal of my shoe, the expedient was
abortive. I have several other pairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Don't know what the deuce you're driving at,
ma'am. Sorry I disturbed the thing. Shall I put it back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I will thank you to restore it to me. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>hands shoe, and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>crosses, and
puts it on cabinet</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Thank you! (<i>she returns and
sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>) Now, with your permission, I will resume
what I was saying to Mr. Pillenger when you
came in. (<i>the men exchange glances</i>) I warned you
last night I should consider it my duty to acquaint Lucy
with the details of&mdash;my&mdash;very painful discovery (<span class="smcap">Dor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>vaston</span>
<i>starts to go off at window</i>; <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>follows
his example upstairs</i>) but I find she has gone out for
a walk&mdash;at least so I imagine. Well&mdash;Audley&mdash;Audley
(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>calls</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>back, and he calls</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>back</i>; <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span> <i>sits on settle, and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>leans on balustrade</i>) Well, Audley, the painful discovery
I allude to was this. After returning home last
night I had occasion to visit the kitchen in order to
speak to Cook for a moment. While doing so, I heard
a mysterious noise. I investigated its origin, and found
Captain Dorvaston concealed in the broom cupboard.
He was unable to give me any lucid explanation. I
now leave the matter in your hands. (<i>slight pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I don't know whether it's much good me saying
anything&mdash;is it, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>rises</i>) I think otherwise. (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>surprised</i>)
I shall be very happy to hear anything you
care to tell me. Appearances are often misleading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But, Audley, surely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah, the matter has now been submitted to
my judgment. I shall not approach it in a spirit of
carping doubt. If our dear friend can give us his
personal assurance that the whole thing was&mdash;a&mdash;little
joke for instance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> A little joke!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> If he could tell us that in concealing himself
in the&mdash;er&mdash;broom cupboard, he had an idea of jumping
out suddenly and startling somebody by saying
"Boo"&mdash;not you particularly&mdash;but Cook, or Keziah, or
myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You? What should you be doing in the
kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No&mdash;that is so; but still, though I deprecate
practical joking as a rule, I should consider the explanation
as not being without a certain measure of
antecedent plausibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You appear to be putting words into Captain
Dorvaston's mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> No, pardon me, I merely say that such a line
of defence would carry conviction to an unbiased mind.
The army is proverbially a light-hearted profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well, sir, I'm afraid I can't exactly say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> There!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> In any case, Hannah, our friend Dorvaston is
Lucy's responsibility. (<i>leans on mantel</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> At all events, Cook is <i>yours</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Eh? Hum&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You will of course ring the bell and discharge
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;really think we should endeavour to avoid
any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Her continued presence in the house
would be an insult to <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>loudly</i>) To avoid any appearance of temper&mdash;do
you hear me, Hannah?&mdash;of temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>) Upon my soul,
ma'am, Cook hadn't anything to do with it. I was there
against her wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Surely that is a most convincing
testimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I know last night things didn't look quite
square, but whatever fault there <i>was</i>, was my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Precisely! No doubt! (<i>the men look at each
other</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I was chatting to Cook&mdash;it was a stoopid thing
to do&mdash;but there was no harm in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> None whatever, I feel sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> In fact, the governor knows there wasn't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> How should my brother know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hum!&mdash;tut&mdash;tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> How! Why, because he was in the lar&mdash;&mdash; (<i>pause</i>,
<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>stares, both men stare at each
other with their mouths open</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) I was sure to take a broad-minded
view. Doubtless that is our friend's meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes, that is what I meant. It got late, and I
heard you coming, ma'am, and I knew you're a bit strict,
don't you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Quite so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> And as I was supposed to be seedy, I thought
you'd take my being there the wrong way, don't you
see? So I&mdash;nipped into the broom cupboard, don't you
understand? (<i>crosses up back</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>crosses to top of table</i>) To a moderately impartial
intelligence the whole thing is as clear as day,
and really reflects discredit on no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Is it your intention to say nothing to Cook
on the subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I think we should give her to understand that
careful investigation has tended to modify our original
misconception of the true facts of the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Then, Audley, I have this to say&mdash;&mdash; (<i>crosses
to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> (<i>at top of steps</i>) I've just found a gent in the
dry ditch at the end of the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>pause</i>) A gent in the ditch! (<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>crosses to balustrade</i>) What gent?&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> 'E was asleep and I shook 'im&mdash;'e grunted, and
I shook 'im again. 'E says his name's Crayll, and 'e'd
like to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Crayll! (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) That is the person
who called on you yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes, I know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> He wished to see <i>me</i>? (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gandy</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> 'E said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Show him in. (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>goes out</i>. <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>
<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Surely a most singular circumstance! Why
did he go to sleep in my ditch? (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>crosses
up to top of window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I suppose, as he's an acquaintance of mine, he
thought you wouldn't object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> He must be very eccentric. (<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>corner</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes, he's a rum sort of chap! (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters,
followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span>, <i>who looks rather dilapidated</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> Mr. Crayll! (<i>at top of steps&mdash;he goes out</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>is at top of steps</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Good mornin'! (<i>at top of steps</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) How are you? (<i>crosses down
and puts hat on settle</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> How are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Think I'll sit down. (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Feel rather
shaky. (<i>he sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>; <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>is standing with
his back to the fireplace</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> By all means. (<i>indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>)
My sister!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh! (<i>he nods carelessly</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> But, my dear sir, (<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) I understand you
passed the night&mdash;or some portion of it&mdash;in er&mdash;the
ditch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> 'Pears I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> But&mdash;how did you get there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> How the devil should I know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut, tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I must have bin sprung last night, that's about
the size of it. I seem to recollect somebody pickin' me
up, and then chuckin' me down again, like a sack of
coals. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>) It wasn't you, was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Certainly not! But you seem to be shivering.
May I offer you anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>from back of table&mdash;coming down a little</i>)
A hot cup of tea?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Tea be damned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut! (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>is shocked, and goes up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> No, I should like a hair of the dog that bit
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>rises excitedly and leans over table</i>) Bitten
by a dog! Good Heavens! My dear sir, the place should
be cauterised at once&mdash;no time should be lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh, don't be such an ass! I mean whiskey.
(<i>looking closely at</i> <span class="smcap">Pillenger</span>) What's that on your
face? What is it? What's that filthy black thing crawling
over your face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;you probably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> What is it? (<i>loudly&mdash;rises excitedly</i>) Why
the devil don't you tell me what it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> A slight accident in shaving. My razor is somewhat
out of condition&mdash;merely sticking plaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh! (<i>subsiding</i>) Thought it was a spider.
(<i>pause</i>) I want to talk to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Yes. (<i>sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Want to say a word or two about your Cook.
(<span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>makes a slight movement</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>
<i>crosses down to chair</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I s'pose you didn't know much about her when
you took her. Did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah, permit me! In answer to your inquiry,
I may say we obtained the highest testimonials
from the Duchess of Sturton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Oh yes, that's all right&mdash;they're pals. (<i>all
start</i>) Did she tell you your Cook was married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Hannah! Hannah! No, sir, she did not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Well she <i>is</i>. Did she say she was a well-known
society woman, who wasn't living with her husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Good gracious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Her Grace did not mention the fact&mdash;if it <i>is</i> a
fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> It <i>is</i>&mdash;you may lay your shirt on it. That
ain't quite the sort of party you want in your kitchen,
is it? Now I happen to know the husband'd be willin'
to overlook the past&mdash;and take her back again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Er&mdash;really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> He's a good-natured beggar, and he don't bear
malice. He put it to her, but she's an obstinate devil&mdash;she
didn't listen to reason. Now it struck me that
as you're a magpie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Tut!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> A magpie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Beg pardon&mdash;I mean as you're a parson, with
your eye on the marriage service&mdash;"Those who Heaven
joined" and all that kind of thing&mdash;you might see your
way to chuckin' her out, neck and crop, without a character&mdash;D'you
see?&mdash;and so bring her to a sense of dooty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Really, Audley, there is something to be
said for this gentleman's suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Whatever course it may ultimately be desirable
for me to adopt, I shall require more definite information
than I at present possess as to the intentions and&mdash;er&mdash;general
identity&mdash;of the alleged husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> You can have it. I'm her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> You! (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>also conveys surprise</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Yes, you ask her; she'll admit she's been married
all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I'll ring for her at once. (<i>makes movement,
rises and crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>hastily</i>) Hold hard! Stop that, old woman!
(<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>pauses</i>) I don't want to see her&mdash;there
wouldn't be any good in that&mdash;the meeting would
be painful all round. (<i>rising</i>) No! you do what I say&mdash;tell
her to pack up her traps and go&mdash;and then my
arms will be open to her. (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>returns and
sits</i>) Good mornin'! (<i>crosses</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>goes</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>intercepts him</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You're not leaving us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Yes, I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I think not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> What d'you mean? I suppose I can go when
I like? (<i>moves forward</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You will go when I like; and before you do,
you've got to face the lady you've just been trying to
injure. Sit down there (<i>pointing to settle</i>) and don't
move, or I shall hurt you! (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>hesitates</i>) Sit
down! (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>sits sulkily</i>) Now I'm going to ring
the bell, and Mr. Pillenger will send for Mrs. Crayll;
but if you try to get away, I shall probably hurt you
rather badly. Do you follow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> That's all right. (<i>crosses and rings bell; to</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span>) Sorry to take the business out of your
hands, sir, but we've got to see it through, don't you
know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I think it would undoubtedly be desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters</i>) Will you ask Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;I mean&mdash;er&mdash;kindly
inform Cook we should like to speak to her.
(<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>goes out</i>, <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>sits; long pause, during
which no one moves</i>) Er&mdash;wonderful how the&mdash;eh&mdash;fine
weather lasts! (<i>another pause</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Then</i> <span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>enters in outdoor costume; she is putting

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> You have something to say to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Yes, we have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That is fortunate, because I have something to
say to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span> <i>makes to speak</i>) Hannah, you
will greatly oblige me by remaining silent. We wished,
Cook&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>near chair</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Pardon me, Mr. Pillenger, I
have no longer any claim to that title&mdash;I beg to hand in
my resignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> You contemplate leaving us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes. I've sent for a fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Audley, since this lady objects to be referred
to as Cook, I think you should address her by her name&mdash;her
real name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>glancing at</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>) I doubt if you
know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> We are better informed than you imagine,
Mrs. Crayll!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Oh, that's it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>rises</i>) My dear madam, pray believe the&mdash;er&mdash;somewhat
startling information came to us unsought.
Our informant was that gentleman. (<i>points to</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Crayll</span>) You can stand up now. (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>rises and crosses down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>, <i>and advances a step or
two</i>. <span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>turns and sees him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I see! (<i>slight pause</i>) Well, what has he told
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> This gentleman came here this morning to
beg us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> To turn me out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Be that as it may, he is anxious to make an
appeal to his, I fear, misguided wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Is he indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I've been tellin' 'em I want you to come back&mdash;man
can't say more, can he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What else did he tell you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> He mentioned you were a well-known woman
in society&mdash;and that you had been living apart from
your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Quite so! Was that all he said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> I think that embraced the whole of Mr. Crayll's
statement. (<i>pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Up to a certain point he told the truth. I did
marry him some years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You concealed the fact when you entered
our service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> It wasn't a thing I felt inclined to boast of.
As he was so confidential, it seems odd he forgot to
tell you we were recently divorced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Divorced!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Divorced!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> There is one other thing&mdash;I think it is only fair
you should know what a distinguished individual you
have been entertaining in the person of Mr. Crayll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> Keep your infernal tongue between your teeth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> This gentleman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> I shan't stay here to be baited&mdash;and badgered.
(<i>going</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>advancing</i>) You'll stay where you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> This gentleman is Lord Huntworth, I am&mdash;I
was Lady Huntworth. (<i>all convey astonishment</i>) Last
night Lord Huntworth dropped in the kitchen a letter.
It was from a firm of solicitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cray.</span> (<i>putting his hand to his breast pocket</i>)
Damn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Telling him I had inherited a large sum of
money. Lord Huntworth is rather hard up just now.
There is nothing unusual in the circumstance, but I
mention it because it explains the reason of his generous
offer to condone the past. (<i>pause</i>) Here is your
letter; (<i>producing it</i>) you needn't trouble to answer
it&mdash;I shall call on Messrs. Brampton and Stokes in the
course of the day. (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span> <i>snatches the letter</i>) I don't
think we need detain you any longer, need we? (<span class="smcap">Crayll</span>
<i>turns for hat</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <i>snarls at</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span> <i>and exits up steps</i>;
<span class="smcap">Caroline</span> <i>watches him off</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> Is it actually the case that you are the Lady
Huntworth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>turns to the</i> <span class="smcap">Pillengers</span>) Yes, I am the Lady
Huntworth who is so widely and so very unfavourably
known. (<i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>) Would you oblige me
by ringing the bell, Captain Dorvaston?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Certainly? (<i>he does so</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>again speaking to the</i> <span class="smcap">Pillengers</span>) If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
thought there was even a chance that you could understand
my doing what I have done I would try to make
it clear to you, but you couldn't&mdash;I should only waste
your time and my own. (<span class="smcap">Gandy</span> <i>enters</i>) Gandy, has
the fly come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> It 'as.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Thanks! Good-bye! (<i>she holds out her hand,
he takes it respectfully</i>) We've been good friends,
haven't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gan.</span> We 'ave; servin' with you 'as bin a honour.
(<i>exit</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>smiling and to the</i> <span class="smcap">Pillengers</span>) Mr. Pillenger&mdash;(<i>he
rises</i>) You have done everything in your power
to render my little experiment a pleasant one. I am
grateful; and if your thoughts should ever turn in my
direction I hope you will let your mind dwell on the
excellence of my curried chicken, rather than on the
supposed hopelessness of my moral character. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pil.</span> (<i>bows sadly</i>) Good-bye! (<i>sits disconsolate</i>;
<span class="smcap">Cook</span> <i>nods to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillenger</span> <i>pleasantly; then turns and
gives a very stately bow to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pillenger</span>, <i>who stiffly

the steps and speaks to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorvaston</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> We have already taken leave of each other, but
it has occurred to me that perhaps you might care to
let me hear from you. I am leaving England for
some time, but that address will find me. (<i>gives a
